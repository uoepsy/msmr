    "text": "Multivariate Statistics and Methodology in R (MSMR) is an advanced semester-long course designed for Masters students in psychology seeking a deeper understanding of statistical techniques to analyze complex data sets with multiple sources of variation. Building on the foundation laid by the Univariate Statistics and Methodology in R (USMR) course, MSMR extends students’ analytical repertoire to encompass multilevel models, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM).\nThe initial half of the course introduces students to the intricacies of multilevel models, providing a solid theoretical framework for understanding hierarchical data structures. Students will gain practical insights into applying these models to address research questions involving nested data and varying sources of variation.\nThe second half of the course delves into methods such as PCA and EFA for reducing dimensionality of data, before moving to Confirmatory Factor models and subsequently Structural Equation Models as a means of modeling and testing our theories about psychological constructs."

    "text": "Data: msmr_apespecies.csv & msmr_apeage.csv\nWe have data from a large sample of great apes who have been studied between the ages of 1 to 10 years old (i.e. during adolescence). Our data includes 4 species of great apes: Chimpanzees, Bonobos, Gorillas and Orangutans. Each ape has been assessed on a primate dominance scale at various ages. Data collection was not very rigorous, so apes do not have consistent assessment schedules (i.e., one may have been assessed at ages 1, 3 and 6, whereas another at ages 2 and 8).\nThe researchers are interested in examining how the adolescent development of dominance in great apes differs between species.\nData on the dominance scores of the apes are available at https://uoepsy.github.io/data/msmr_apeage.csv and the information about which species each ape is are in https://uoepsy.github.io/data/msmr_apespecies.csv.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Data Dictionary: msmr_apespecies.csv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvariable\ndescription\n\n\n\n\nape\nApe Name\n\n\nspecies\nSpecies (Bonobo, Chimpanzee, Gorilla, Orangutan)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Data Dictionary: msmr_apeage.csv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvariable\ndescription\n\n\n\n\nape\nApe Name\n\n\nage\nAge at assessment (years)\n\n\ndominance\nDominance (Z-scored)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 1\n\n\nRead in the data and check over it. Do any relevant cleaning/wrangling that might be necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n1 - reading and joining\n\n\n\nSolution 1. We’ll read in both datasets, and then join them together.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(lme4)\nape_species &lt;- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/msmr_apespecies.csv\")\nape_age &lt;- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/msmr_apeage.csv\")\n\nSometimes is handy to check that all our participants are in both datasets:\n\n# are all the apes in ape_age also in ape_species?\nall(ape_age$ape %in% ape_species$ape)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n# and vice versa?\nall(ape_species$ape %in% ape_age$ape)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\noptional - working with sets!\n\n\n\n\n\nI often default to using %in% and asking several questions to carefully make sure I know what’s going on - i.e. “is all of A %in% B? and is all of B %in% A, … etc.”\nThere is actually a neat way to ask these questions both at once using some handy functions (that I often forget about) to perform operations on “sets” (i.e. collections of things). These include:\n\nunion(x,y) - return everything that is in set x or in set y (or both)\nintersect(x,y) - return everything that is in both x and y\nsetdiff(x,y) - return everything in x that is not in y (not there’s asymmetry here!)\nsetequal(x,y) - are sets x and y equal?\n\nSo we can use these to ask if, e.g., the two sets of apes in each dataset are equal:\n\nsetequal(ape_species$ape,ape_age$ape)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nIf you want a fun1 challenge, there are lots of other (less concise ways) that we can ask the same thing. Try and come up with a few different ways.\nE.g.: “is there anything in the union of the two sets that is not in the intersection of the two sets?”\n\nsetdiff(union(ape_species$ape,ape_age$ape), \n        intersect(ape_species$ape,ape_age$ape))\n\ncharacter(0)\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay, both datasets contain data for the same set of apes.\nLet’s join them:\n\napedat &lt;- full_join(ape_age, ape_species)\nhead(apedat)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  ape     age dominance species   \n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;     \n1 Joel      7       0.6 chimpanzee\n2 Joel      5       1.2 chimpanzee\n3 Joel      8       1.1 chimpanzee\n4 Joel      1       0.2 chimpanzee\n5 Joel      2       0.5 chimpanzee\n6 Joel      6       1   chimpanzee\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 - identifying issues\n\n\n\nSolution 2. First off, we can see that we’ve got some weird typos. Some apes have been identified as “gorrila” but it is actually spelled “gorilla”.\nAlso, we’ve got people using two alternatives for the chimps: “chimp” and “chimpanzee”. We’ll need to combine those.\n\ntable(apedat$species)\n\n\n    bonobo      chimp chimpanzee    gorilla    gorrila  orangutan \n       187        146        127        211          2        157 \n\n\nAge looks like it has some weird values (possibly “-99”?), and there are possibly a few outliers in the dominance variable. Given that dominance is standardised, it is extremely unlikely that we would see values around 20.. They’re not “impossible”, but they’re so incredibly unlikely that I’d be more comfortable assuming they are typos:\n\nhist(apedat$age, breaks=20)\nhist(apedat$dominance, breaks=20)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust to see what the most extreme values of dominance are:\n\n# show the biggest 5 absolute values in dominance variable\nsort(abs(apedat$dominance), decreasing = TRUE)[1:5]\n\n[1] 21.2 19.4  3.9  2.9  2.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 - cleaning up\n\n\n\nSolution 3. \n\napedat &lt;- apedat |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    # fix species typos\n    species = case_when(\n      species %in% c(\"chimp\",\"chimpanzee\") ~ \"chimp\",\n      species %in% c(\"gorilla\",\"gorrila\") ~ \"gorilla\",\n      TRUE ~ species\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n    filter(\n      # get rid of ages -99\n      age &gt; 0, \n      # keep when dominance is between -5 and 5 \n      # (5 here is a slightly arbitrary choice, but you can see from\n      # our checks that this will only exclude the two extreme datapoints\n      # that are 21.2 and 19.4\n      (dominance &lt; 5 & dominance &gt; -5) \n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\n\n\nHow is this data structure “hierarchical” (or “clustered”)? How many levels do we have, and what are the observational units at each level?\n\n\n\n\nWe have a random sample of \\(\\underbrace{\\text{timepoints}}_{\\text{level 1}}\\) from a random sample of \\(\\underbrace{\\text{apes}}_{\\text{level 2}}\\).\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3\n\n\nFor how many apes do we have data? How many of each species?\nHow many datapoints does each ape have?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’ve seen this last week too - counting the different levels in our data. See Chapter 4: logisticMLM - #getting-to-know-my-monkeys for an example (also about monkeys!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have 168 apes in our dataset:\n\nlength(unique(apedat$ape))\n\n[1] 168\n\n\nHere’s how many of each species:\n\napedat |&gt; \n  group_by(species) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n   n_apes = n_distinct(ape) \n  )\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 2\n  species   n_apes\n  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;int&gt;\n1 bonobo        36\n2 chimp         56\n3 gorilla       46\n4 orangutan     30\n\n\nLet’s create a table of how many observations for each ape, and then we can create a table from that table, to show how many apes have 2 datapoints, how many have 3, 4, and so on:\n\ntable(apedat$ape) |&gt;\n  table() |&gt;\n  barplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 4\n\n\nMake a plot to show how dominance changes for each ape as they get older.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Chapter 5: Longitudinal MLM - #exploring-the-data we made a facet for each cluster (each participant). That was fine because we had only 20 people. In this dataset we have 168! That’s too many to facet. We could try using group aesthetic instead, to plot multiple lines on the same plot, or we could just plot a sample of our apes. This is all just an initial look at the data, after all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s a line for each ape, and a facet for each species:\n\nggplot(apedat, aes(x = age, y = dominance, col = species))+\n  geom_line(aes(group = ape)) + \n  facet_wrap(~species) + \n  guides(col=\"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s kind of hard to see the trend for each ape, so let’s also make a separate little linear model for each ape:\n\nggplot(apedat, aes(x = age, y = dominance, col = species))+\n  geom_smooth(aes(group = ape), method=lm, se=FALSE) + \n  facet_wrap(~species) + \n  guides(col=\"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, let’s take a sample of apes, and plot the same stuff but facetted:\n\napedat |&gt;\n  # choose the rows where ape ID is one of a random sample of 16 ape IDs\n  filter(ape %in% sample(unique(apedat$ape), 16) ) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = dominance, col = species))+\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, se=FALSE)+\n  facet_wrap(~ape)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 5\n\n\nRecenter the age variable so that “0” becomes a 1-year old, which is the youngest age that we’ve got data on for any of our species.\nThen fit a model that estimates the differences between primate species in how dominance changes over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\nthink slowly about “differences between primate species in how dominance changes over time”.\n\n“how dominance changes over time” – sounds like dominance ~ time\nso differences between primate species in this would require the interaction dominance ~ time * species\nwe have a random sample of apes, and for each of these we have multiple observations. We can model these as by-ape random effects - + (...... | ape)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\napedat$age = apedat$age-1 \n\nm.full &lt;- lmer(dominance ~ 1 + age * species + (1 + age | ape), data = apedat)\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 6\n\n\nDo primate species differ in the growth of dominance?\nPerform an appropriate test/comparison.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is asking about the age*species interaction, which in our model is represented by 3 parameters. To assess the overall question, it might make more sense to do a model comparison.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nm.int &lt;- lmer(dominance ~ 1 + age + species + (1 + age | ape), data = apedat)\n\nanova(m.int, m.full)\n\nData: apedat\nModels:\nm.int: dominance ~ 1 + age + species + (1 + age | ape)\nm.full: dominance ~ 1 + age * species + (1 + age | ape)\n       npar    AIC    BIC  logLik -2*log(L)  Chisq Df Pr(&gt;Chisq)   \nm.int     9 806.67 849.11 -394.34    788.67                        \nm.full   12 801.16 857.74 -388.58    777.16 11.517  3   0.009237 **\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\n\nSpecies differ in how dominance changes over adolescence (\\(\\chi^2(3) = 11.52, p = 0.009\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 7\n\n\nPlot the average model predicted values for each age.\nBefore you plot.. do you expect to see straight lines? (remember, not every ape is measured at age 2, or age 3, etc).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is like taking predict() from the model, and then then grouping by age, and calculating the mean of those predictions. However, we can do this more easily using augment() and then some fancy stat_summary() in ggplot (see the lecture).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAveraging fitted values would give us straight lines if every ape had data at all ages, but in our study we have some apes with only 2 data points, and each ape has different set of ages (e.g., one ape might be measured at age 3, 6, and 10, another ape might be at ages 2 and 16).\n\nlibrary(broom.mixed)\n\naugment(m.full) |&gt;\nggplot(aes(age,dominance, color=species)) +\n  # the point ranges are our observations\n  stat_summary(fun.data=mean_se, geom=\"pointrange\") + \n  # the lines are our average predictions  \n  stat_summary(aes(y=.fitted, linetype=species), fun=mean, geom=\"line\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 8\n\n\nPlot the model based fixed effects:\n\n\n\n\n\neffects::effect(\"age*species\", m.full, xlevels=10) |&gt;\n  as.data.frame() |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x=age+1,y=fit,col=species))+\n  geom_line(lwd=1)+\n  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=lower,ymax=upper,fill=species),col=NA,alpha=.3) +  \n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"grey30\",\"black\",\"grey50\",\"darkorange\")) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"grey30\",\"black\",\"grey50\",\"darkorange\")) +\n  facet_wrap(~species) + \n  guides(col=\"none\",fill=\"none\") +\n  labs(x=\"Age (years)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 9\n\n\nIdentify what each of the fixed effects from the model represents (you might also want to get some p-values or confidence intervals).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\nEach of the estimates should correspond to part of our plot from the previous question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s get some confidence intervals:\n\nconfint(m.full, method=\"profile\",\n        parm = \"beta_\")\n\n                           2.5 %      97.5 %\n(Intercept)          -0.67066925 -0.17299177\nage                   0.02361398  0.08142209\nspecieschimp          0.13383485  0.77009884\nspeciesgorilla        0.28124162  0.94933844\nspeciesorangutan     -0.38909919  0.34257548\nage:specieschimp     -0.03973125  0.03392308\nage:speciesgorilla   -0.05012759  0.02799393\nage:speciesorangutan -0.10625760 -0.02167806\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nest\nCI\ninterpretation\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n-0.42\n[-0.67, -0.17]*\nestimated dominance of 1 year old bonobos (at left hand side of plot, bonobo line is lower than 0)\n\n\nage\n0.05\n[0.02, 0.08]*\nestimated change in dominance score for every year older a bonobo gets (slope of bonobo line)\n\n\nspecieschimp\n0.45\n[0.13, 0.77]*\nestimated difference in dominance scores at age 1 between bonobos and chimps (at left hand side of plot, chimp line is higher than bonobo line)\n\n\nspeciesgorilla\n0.62\n[0.28, 0.95]*\nestimated difference in dominance scores at age 1 between bonobos and gorillas (at left hand side of plot, gorilla line is higher than bonobo line)\n\n\nspeciesorangutan\n-0.02\n[-0.39, 0.34]\nno significant difference in dominance scores at age 1 between bonobos and orangutans (at the left hand side of our plot, orangutan line is similar height to bonobo line)\n\n\nage:specieschimp\n0.00\n[-0.04, 0.03]\nno significant difference between chimps and bonobos in the change in dominance for every year older (slope of chimp line is similar to slope of bonobo line)\n\n\nage:speciesgorilla\n-0.01\n[-0.05, 0.03]\nno significant difference between gorillas and bonobos in the change in dominance for every year older (slope of gorilla line is similar to slope of bonobo line)\n\n\nage:speciesorangutan\n-0.06\n[-0.11, -0.02]*\nestimated difference between orangutans and bonobos in the change in dominance for every year older (slope of orangutan line is less steep than slope of bonobo line)",

    "text": "Workplace Pride\n\nData: lmm_jsup.csv\nA questionnaire was sent to all UK civil service departments, and the lmm_jsup.csv dataset contains all responses that were received. Some of these departments work as hybrid or ‘virtual’ departments, with a mix of remote and office-based employees. Others are fully office-based.\nThe questionnaire included items asking about how much the respondent believe in the department and how it engages with the community, what it produces, how it operates and how treats its people. A composite measure of ‘workplace-pride’ was constructed for each employee. Employees in the civil service are categorised into 3 different roles: A, B and C. The roles tend to increase in responsibility, with role C being more managerial, and role A having less responsibility. We also have data on the length of time each employee has been in the department (sometimes new employees come straight in at role C, but many of them start in role A and work up over time).\nWe’re interested in whether the different roles are associated with differences in workplace-pride.\nDataset: https://uoepsy.github.io/data/lmm_jsup.csv.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvariable\ndescription\n\n\n\n\ndepartment_name\nName of government department\n\n\ndept\nDepartment Acronym\n\n\nvirtual\nWhether the department functions as hybrid department with various employees working remotely (1), or as a fully in-person office (0)\n\n\nrole\nEmployee role (A, B or C)\n\n\nseniority\nEmployees seniority point.

Specifically, compared to people in role A, people who are in roles B and C on average report less pride in the workplace.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3\n\n\nIs it something about the roles that make people report differences in workplace-pride, or is it possibly just that people who are newer to the company tend to feel more pride than those who have been there for a while (they’re all jaded), and the people in role A tend to be much newer to the company (making it look like the role A results in taking more pride). In other words, if we were to compare people in role A vs role B vs role C but hold constant their employment_length, we might see something different?\nFit another model to find out.\nTo help with interpreting the model, make a plot that shows all of the relevant variables that are in the model in one way or another.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\nSo we want to adjust for how long people have been part of the company..\nRemember - if we want to estimate the effect of x on y while adjusting for z, we can do lm(y ~ z + x).\nFor the plot - put something on the x, something on the y, and colour it by the other variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nSolution 3. \n\nmod2 &lt;- lm(wp ~ employment_length + role, data = jsup)\n\ntidy(mod2)\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 5\n  term              estimate std.error statistic   p.value\n  &lt;chr&gt;                &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)         36.1      0.709     50.9   6.90e-147\n2 employment_length   -0.834    0.0637   -13.1   4.32e- 31\n3 roleB                0.510    0.563      0.906 3.65e-  1\n4 roleC               -0.704    0.663     -1.06  2.89e-  1\n\n\nNote that, after adjusting for employment length, there are no significant differences in wp between roles B or C compared to A.\nIf we plot the data to show all these variables together, we can kind of see why! Given the pattern of wp against employment_length, the wp for different roles are pretty much where we would expect them to be if role doesn’t make any difference (i.e., if role doesn’t shift your wp up or down).\n\nggplot(jsup, aes(x=employment_length,y=wp,col=role))+\n  geom_point(size=3,alpha=.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 4\n\n\nDo roles differ in their workplace-pride, when adjusting for time in the company?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\nThis may feel like a repeat of the previous question, but note that this is not a question about specific group differences. It is about whether, overall, the role groups differ. So it’s wanting to test the joint effect of the two additional parameters we’ve just added to our model. (hint hint model comparison!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nSolution 4. \n\nmod2a &lt;- lm(wp ~ employment_length, data = jsup)\nmod2 &lt;- lm(wp ~ employment_length + role, data = jsup)\n\nanova(mod2a, mod2)\n\nAnalysis of Variance Table\n\nModel 1: wp ~ employment_length\nModel 2: wp ~ employment_length + role\n  Res.Df    RSS Df Sum of Sq      F Pr(&gt;F)\n1    293 4090.8                           \n2    291 4028.9  2    61.864 2.2342 0.1089\n\n\nThis is no surprise given the previous question, we just now have a single test to report if we wanted to - after accounting for employment length, role does not explain a significant amount of variance in workplace pride.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 5\n\n\nLet’s take a step back and remember what data we actually have. We’ve got 295 people in our dataset, from 16 departments.\nDepartments may well differ in the general amount of workplace-pride people report. People love to say that they work in the “National Crime Agency”, but other departments might not elicit such pride (*cough* HM Revenue & Customs *cough*). We need to be careful not to mistake department differences as something else (like differences due to the job role).\nMake a couple of plots to look at:\n\nhow many of each role we have from each department\nhow departments differ in their employees’ pride in their workplace\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nSolution 5. \n\nggplot(jsup, aes(x = role)) + \n  geom_bar()+\n  facet_wrap(~dept)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, it looks like most of the departments have similar numbers of each role, apart from the UKSA (“UK Statistics Authority”), where we’ve got loads more of role A, and very few role C..\nNote also that in the plot below, the UKSA is, on average, full of employees who take a lot of pride in their work. Is this due to the high proportion of people in role A? or is the effect of role we’re seeing more due to differences in departments?\n\nggplot(jsup, aes(x = dept, y = wp)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  scale_x_discrete(labels = label_wrap_gen(35)) + \n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven if we had perfectly equal numbers of roles in each department, we’re also adjusting for other things such as employment_length, and the extent to which this differs by department can have trickle-on effects on our coefficient of interest (the role coefficients).\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 6\n\n\nAdjusting for both length of employment and department, are there differences in ‘workplace-pride’ between the different roles?\nCan you make a plot of all four of the variables involved in our model?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking the plot might take some thinking. We’ve now added dept into the mix, so a nice way might be to use facet_wrap() to make the same plot as the one we did previously, but for each department.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nSolution 6. \n\nmod3 &lt;- lm(wp ~ employment_length + dept + role, data = jsup)\ntidy(mod3)\n\n# A tibble: 19 × 5\n   term              estimate std.error statistic   p.value\n   &lt;chr&gt;                &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 (Intercept)        36.4       0.631    57.6    7.17e-156\n 2 employment_length  -0.882     0.0344  -25.7    4.71e- 75\n 3 deptCMA            -3.80      0.649    -5.85   1.39e-  8\n 4 deptCPS            -0.217     0.730    -0.298  7.66e-  1\n 5 deptFSA             4.74      0.625     7.60   4.71e- 13\n 6 deptGLD             0.0582    0.682     0.0853 9.32e-  1\n 7 deptHMRC           -3.79      0.692    -5.47   1.02e-  7\n 8 deptNCA            -3.85      0.655    -5.88   1.18e-  8\n 9 deptNS&I           -0.574     0.654    -0.878  3.81e-  1\n10 deptOFGEM          -0.648     0.705    -0.919  3.59e-  1\n11 deptOFQUAL         -4.94      1.01     -4.89   1.71e-  6\n12 deptOFSTED         -5.88      0.683    -8.61   5.52e- 16\n13 deptOFWAT          -1.21      0.692    -1.75   8.17e-  2\n14 deptORR            -2.85      0.681    -4.18   3.98e-  5\n15 deptSFO            -1.36      0.672    -2.02   4.47e-  2\n16 deptUKSA            4.28      0.576     7.43   1.32e- 12\n17 deptUKSC           -2.31      0.732    -3.16   1.77e-  3\n18 roleB               1.42      0.303     4.68   4.47e-  6\n19 roleC               1.31      0.366     3.59   3.92e-  4\n\n\nIn a way, adding predictors to our model is kind of like splitting up our plots by that predictor to see the patterns. This becomes more and more difficult (/impossible) as we get more variables, but right now we can split the data into all the constituent parts.\n\nggplot(jsup, aes(x = employment_length, y = wp, col = role)) +\n  geom_point(size=3,alpha=.4)+\n  facet_wrap(~dept)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe association between wp and employment_length is clear in all these little sub-plots - there’s a downward trend. The department differences can be seen too: UKSA is generally a bit higher, HMRC and UKSC a bit lower, and so on. By default, the model captures these coefficients as ‘differences from the reference group’, so all these coefficients are in relation to the “ACE” department.\nSeeing the role differences is a bit harder in this plot, but think about what you would expect to see if there were no differences in roles (i.e. imagine if they were all in role A). Take for instance the FSA department, where this is easiest to see - for the people who are in role C, for people of their employment length we would expect their wp to be lower if they were in role A. Likewise for those in role B. Across all these departments, the people in role B and C (green and blue dots respectively) are a bit higher than we would expect. This is what the model coefficients tell us!\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 7\n\n\nNow we’re starting to acknowledge the grouped structure of our data - these people in our dataset are related to one another in that some belong to dept 1, some dept 2, and so on..\nLet’s try to describe our sample in a bit more detail.\n\nhow many participants do we have, and from how many departments?\nhow many participants are there, on average, from each department? what is the minimum and maximum?\nwhat is the average employment length for our participants?\nhow many departments are ‘virtual departments’ vs office-based?\n\nwhat is the overall average reported workplace-pride?\nhow much variation in workplace-pride is due to differences between departments?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first lot of these questions can be answered using things like count(), summary(), table(), mean(), min() etc. See 1: Clustered Data #determining-sample-sizes\nFor the last one, we can use the ICC! See 1: Clustered Data #icc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nSolution 7.

What happens?\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nSolution 8. Let’s add the virtual predictor to our model.

If we think about it, if we separate out “differences due to departments” then there is nothing left to compare between departments that are virtual vs office based. Adding the between-department predictor of virtual doesn’t explain anything more - the residual sums of squares doesn’t decrease at all:\n\nanova(\n  lm(wp ~ employment_length + dept + role, data = jsup),\n  lm(wp ~ employment_length + dept + role + virtual, data = jsup)\n)\n\nAnalysis of Variance Table\n\nModel 1: wp ~ employment_length + dept + role\nModel 2: wp ~ employment_length + dept + role + virtual\n  Res.Df    RSS Df Sum of Sq F Pr(&gt;F)\n1    276 1083.8                      \n2    276 1083.8  0         0         \n\n\nAnother way of thinking about this: knowing the average workplace-pride for the department that someone is in tells me what to expect about that person’s workplace pride. But once I know their department’s average workplace-pride, knowing whether it is ‘virtual’ or ‘office-based’ doesn’t tell me anything new, for the very fact that the virtual/office-based distinction comes from comparing different departments.\nBut we’re not really interested in these departments specifically! What would be nice would be if we can look at the relevant effects of interest (things like role and virtual), but then just think of the department differences as just some sort of random variation. So we want to think of departments in a similar way to how we think of our individual employees - they vary randomly around what we expect - only they’re at a different level of observation. Such an approach is what we will learn about this semester - “multilevel models”!",

You can load the dataset using:\n\nload(url(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/Az.rda\"))\n\nand you will find the Az object in your environment.\nThe Az object contains information on 30 Participants with probable Alzheimer’s Disease, who completed 3 tasks over 10 time points: A memory task, and two scales investigating ability to undertake complex activities of daily living (cADL) and simple activities of daily living (sADL). Performance on all of tasks was calculated as a percentage of total possible score, thereby ranging from 0 to 100.\nWe’re interested in whether performance on these tasks differed at the outset of the study, and if they differed in their subsequent change in performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvariable\ndescription\n\n\n\n\nSubject\nUnique Subject Identifier\n\n\nTime\nTime point of the study (1 to 10)\n\n\nTask\nTask type (Memory, cADL, sADL)\n\n\nPerformance\nScore on test (range 0 to 100)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 1\n\n\nLoad in the data and examine it.\nHow many participants, how many observations per participant, per task?\n\n\n\n\n\nload(url(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/Az.rda\"))\nsummary(Az)\n\n    Subject         Time          Task      Performance   \n 1      : 30   Min.   : 1.0   cADL  :300   Min.   : 2.00  \n 2      : 30   1st Qu.: 3.0   sADL  :300   1st Qu.:40.00  \n 3      : 30   Median : 5.5   Memory:300   Median :52.00  \n 4      : 30   Mean   : 5.5                Mean   :49.27  \n 5      : 30   3rd Qu.: 8.0                3rd Qu.:61.00  \n 6      : 30   Max.   :10.0                Max.   :85.00  \n (Other):720                                              \n\n\n30 participants:\n\nlength(unique(Az$Subject))\n\n[1] 30\n\n\nDoes every participant have 10 datapoints for each Task type?

Why? Because this way you can get a shape of the average trajectories of performance over time in each task.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\nFor an example plot, see Chapter 6: polynomial growth #example-in-mlm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use “pointranges”, or “line” and “ribbon”.\nstat_summary will take the data and for each value of x calculate some function (in this case the mean, or the mean and SE):\n\nggplot(Az, aes(Time, Performance, color=Task, fill=Task)) + \n  stat_summary(fun.data=mean_se, geom=\"ribbon\", color=NA, alpha=0.5) +\n  stat_summary(fun=mean, geom=\"line\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3\n\n\nWhy do you think raw/natural polynomials might be more useful than orthogonal polynomials for these data?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\nAre we somewhat interested in group differences (i.e. differences in scores, or differences in rate of change) at a specific point in time?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause we’re interested in whether there are task differences at the starting point, raw polynomials are probably what we want here.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 4\n\n\nRe-center the Time variable so that the intercept is the first timepoint.\nThen choose an appropriate degree of polynomial (if any), and fit a full model that allows us to address the research aims.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\nNote there is no part of the research question that specifically asks about how “gradual” or “quick” the change is (which would suggest we are interested in the quadratic term).\nHowever, plots (summarised at the task level, and of individual participant’s data separately) can help to give us a sense of what degree of polynomial terms might be suitable to succinctly describe the trends.\nIn many cases, fitting higher and higher order polynomials will likely result in a ‘better fit’ to our sample data, but these will be worse and worse at generalising to new data - i.e. we run the risk of overfitting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 - how many polynomials?\n\n\n\nSolution 1. In our plot, there were 2 straight line and one slightly curvy one. It wasn’t S-shaped or ‘wiggly’ or anything, there was just a bit of a bend in it, which suggests that the quadratic term could be a good approximation here.\nIt’s worth also looking at the individual participant trajectories. In these we can also see the curvi-ness of the blue line - it’s more pronounced for some people than others, but it does seem like individual’s trajectories on the Memory task may be curvilinear.\n\nggplot(Az, aes(Time, Performance, color=Task, fill=Task)) + \n  stat_summary(fun.data=mean_se, geom=\"ribbon\", color=NA, alpha=0.5) +\n  stat_summary(fun=mean, geom=\"line\")+\n  facet_wrap(~Subject)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(lme4)\nAz &lt;- Az |&gt; mutate(\n  Time1 = Time-1,\n  poly1 = poly(Time1,2,raw=T)[,1],\n  poly2 = poly(Time1,2,raw=T)[,2]\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOr using Dan’s code:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# import Dan's code:\nsource(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/msmr/functions/code_poly.R\")\n\n# this also produces a nice little plot to show the polynomials\nAz$Time1 &lt;- Az$Time-1\nAz &lt;- code_poly(df = Az, predictor = 'Time1',\n                poly.order = 2, orthogonal = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 - fixed effects\n\n\n\nSolution 2. We’re interested in how performance changes over time, but we have poly1 and poly2 for time, so we’re at:\nlmer(Performance ~ poly1 + poly2 ... \nOur research aims are to investigate differences between task performance (both at baseline and change over time). So we want to interact time with task:\nlmer(Performance ~ (poly1 + poly2)*Task ... \n\n\n\n\n\n3 - grouping structure\n\n\n\nSolution 3. \n\nhead(Az)\n\n  Subject Time Task Performance Time1 poly1 poly2\n1       1    1 cADL          65     0     0     0\n2       1    2 cADL          61     1     1     1\n3       1    3 cADL          53     2     2     4\n4       1    4 cADL          46     3     3     9\n5       1    5 cADL          42     4     4    16\n6       1    6 cADL          35     5     5    25\n\n\nWe have 900 observations, and 30 for each participant.\nlmer(Performance ~ (poly1 + poly2)*Task ... +\n                   (1 + .... | Subject)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFixed vs Random\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can account for group differences in models either by estimating group differences, or by estimating variance between groups:\n\ngroup as a fixed effect (y ~ 1 + group) = groups differ in \\(y\\) by \\(b_1, b_2, ..., b_k\\)\n\ngroup as a random effect (y ~ 1 + (1|group)) = groups vary in \\(y\\) with a standard deviation of \\(\\sigma_0\\)\n\nOne way to think about whether a group is best in the random effects part or in the fixed part of our model is to think about “what would happen if I repeated the experiment?”\nShould variable g be fixed or random?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepetition:  If the experiment were repeated:\nDesired inference:  The conclusions refer to:\n\n\n\n\nFixed\\(y\\,\\sim\\,~\\,...\\, +\\, g\\)\nSame groups would be used\nThe groups used\n\n\nRandom\\(y\\,\\sim\\,...\\,+\\,(\\,... |\\,g)\\)\nDifferent groups would be used\nA population from which the groups used are just a (random) sample\n\n\n\nPractical points:\n- Sometimes there isn’t enough variability between groups to model as random effects (i.e. the variance gets estimated as too close to zero). - Sometimes you might not have sufficient number of groups to model as random effects (e.g. for groups of fewer than c8 things, estimates of the variance are often not a reliable reflection of the population).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 - random effects\n\n\n\nSolution 4. What slopes could vary by participant?\nQ: Could participants vary in their performance over time?\nA: Yes, (poly1 + poly2 | Subject)\nQ: Could participants vary in how performance differs between Tasks?\nA: Yes, (poly1 + poly2 + Task | Subject). E.g., Some participants might be much better at the memory task than other tasks, some might be better at the other tasks.\nQ: Could participants vary in how tasks differ in their performance over time?\nA: Yes, ((poly1 + poly2)*Task | Subject). E.g., For some participants, memory could decline more than cADL, for other participants it could decline less.\nlmer(Performance ~ (poly1 + poly2)*Task ... +\n                   (1 + (poly1 + poly2)*Task | Subject)\n\n\n\n\n\n5 - the model\n\n\n\nSolution 5. small note: I’m using the bobyqa optimizer here because it tends to be slightly quicker than the default.\n\nm1 = lmer(Performance ~ (poly1 + poly2) * Task +\n            (1 + (poly1 + poly2) * Task | Subject),\n          data=Az, control=lmerControl(optimizer = \"bobyqa\"))\n\n\nboundary (singular) fit: see help(‘isSingular’) Warning messages: 1: In commonArgs(par, fn, control, environment()) : maxfun &lt; 10 * length(par)^2 is not recommended. 2: In optwrap(optimizer, devfun, getStart(start, rho$pp), lower = rho$lower, : convergence code 1 from bobyqa: bobyqa – maximum number of function evaluations exceeded\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 5\n\n\nOkay, so the model didn’t converge. It’s trying to estimate a lot of things in the random effects (even though it didn’t converge, try looking at VarCorr(model) to see all the covariances it is trying to estimate).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategorical random effects on the RHS\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we have a categorical random effect (i.e. where the x in (1 + x | g) is a categorical variable), then model estimation can often get tricky, because “the effect of x” for a categorical variable with \\(k\\) levels is identified via \\(k-1\\) parameters, meaning we have a lot of variances and covariances to estimate when we include x|g.\n\n\nWhen x is numeric:\nGroups   Name        Std.Dev. Corr  \ng        (Intercept) ...        \n         x           ...      ...\nResidual             ...     \n\n\n\nWhen x is categorical with \\(k\\) levels:\nGroups   Name        Std.Dev. Corr  \ng        (Intercept) ...        \n         xlevel2     ...      ...\n         xlevel3     ...      ...     ...\n         ...         ...      ...     ...     ...\n         xlevelk     ...      ...     ...     ...   ...\nResidual             ...     \n\n\nHowever, we can use an alternative formation of the random effects by putting a categorical x into the right-hand side:\nInstead of (1 + x | g) we can fit (1 | g) + (1 | g:x).\nThe symbol : in g:x is used to refer to the combination of g and x.\n\n\n      g        x     g:x\n1    p1        a    p1.a\n2    p1        a    p1.a\n3    p1        b    p1.b\n4   ...      ...     ...\n5    p2        a    p2.a\n6    p2        b    p2.b\n7   ...      ...     ...\n\n\nIt’s a bit weird to think about it, but these two formulations of the random effects can kind of represent the same idea:\n\n(1 + x | g): each group of g can have a different intercept and a different effect of x\n\n(1 | g) + (1 | g:x): each group of g can have a different intercept, and each level of x within each g can have a different intercept.\n\nBoth of these allow the outcome y to change across x differently for each group in g (i.e. both of them result in y being different for each level of x in each group g).\nThe first does so explicitly by estimating the group level variance of the y~x effect.\nThe second one estimates the variance of \\(y\\) between groups, and also the variance of \\(y\\) between ‘levels of x within groups’. In doing so, it achieves more or less the same thing, but by capturing these as intercept variances between levels of x, we don’t have to worry about lots of covariances:\n\n\n(1 + x | g)\nGroups   Name        Std.Dev. Corr  \ng        (Intercept) ...        \n         xlevel2     ...      ...\n         xlevel3     ...      ...     ...\n         ...         ...      ...     ...     ...\n         xlevelk     ...      ...     ...     ...   ...\nResidual             ...     \n\n\n\n(1 | g) + (1 | g:x)\nGroups   Name        Std.Dev. \ng        (Intercept) ...        \ng.x      (Intercept) ...        \nResidual             ...     \n\n\n\n\n\nTry adjusting your model by first moving Task to the right hand side of the random effects, and from there starting to simplify things (remove random slopes one-by-one)\nThis is our first experience of our random effect structures becoming more complex than simply (.... | group). This is going to feel confusing, but don’t worry, we’ll see more structures like this next week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\n... + (1 + poly1 + poly2 | Subject) + (1 + poly1 + poly2 | Subject:Task)\nTo then start simplifying (if this model doesn’t converge), it can be helpful to look at the VarCorr() of the non-converging model to see if anything looks awry. Look for small variances, perfect (or near perfect) correlations. These might be sensible things to remove.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s our model with subject-task effects on the right hand side.\nAgain we have problems, as we have a singular fit:\n\nm2 = lmer(Performance ~ (poly1 + poly2) * Task +\n            (1 + poly1 + poly2 | Subject) +\n            (1 + poly1 + poly2 | Subject:Task),\n          data=Az, control=lmerControl(optimizer = \"bobyqa\"))\n\n\nboundary (singular) fit: see help(‘isSingular’)\n\nLooking at the random effects of our model, note that the poly2|Subject random effect has very little variance (and high correlations).\nNote that it makes sense that by including the random effects for Subject:Task, there might not be much above that leftover in Subject random effects.\n\nVarCorr(m2)\n\n Groups       Name        Std.Dev.
