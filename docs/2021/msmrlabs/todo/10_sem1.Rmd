## Overview {-}
<div class="noteBox">

Last week we tried our hand at path analysis, which is used to test a set of relations between observed variables. This week's lab is focused on full structural equation modelling, which involves testing sets of relations between observed **AND** latent variables. In this week's example, a researcher wants to apply the theory of planned behaviour to understand engagement in physical activity. The theory of planned behaviour is summarised in Figure \@ref(fig:tpb) (only the latent variables and not the items are shown). Attitudes refer to the extent to which a person had a favourable view of exercising; subjective norms refer to whether they believe others whose opinions they care about believe exercise to be a good thing; and perceived behavioural control refers to the extent to which they believe exercising is under their control. Intentions refer to whether a person intends to exercise and 'behaviour' is a measure of the extent to which they exercised.  Each construct is measured using four items.

## Exercises {-}

`r msmbstyle::question_begin(header="&#x25BA; Last week's write-up")`
Did you do the final exercise (writing up your results) from last week's lab?   
Our example write-up is now visible (see [last week's lab](#path-analysis)) against which you can compare yours.   

<!-- __Please note:__ Writing-up is an important skill, and attempting these questions yourself (rather than simply reading through the example write-ups) will help _a lot_ when it comes to writing your assessment.   -->
`r msmbstyle::question_end()` 
---
`r msmbstyle::question_begin(header="&#x25BA; Question 1")`
Read in the data using the appropriate function. Can you sucessfully read in from both types of data?  
`r msmbstyle::question_end()` 
`r msmbstyle::solution_begin(hidden=HIDDEN_SOLS)`
Either one or the other of:
```{r read in data}
load(url("https://edin.ac/39Uvn7R"))

TPB_data <- read.table("https://edin.ac/3d2svI9", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")
```
`r msmbstyle::solution_end()`
---
`r msmbstyle::question_begin(header="&#x25BA; Question 2")`
Test a one-factor model for each construct. Are the measurement models satisfactory?
`r msmbstyle::question_end()` 
`r msmbstyle::solution_begin(hidden=HIDDEN_SOLS)`
```{r fit CFA models}
#specify one factor CFA model for attitudes
attitude_model<-'att=~attitude1+attitude2+attitude3+attitude4'
#estimate the model
attitude_model.est<-cfa(attitude_model, data=TPB_data)
#inspect the output
summary(attitude_model.est, fit.measures=T, standardized=T)
#check the model fit and that RMSEA<.05, SRMR<.05, TLI>0.95 and CFI>.95 and that all loadings are significant and >|.30|
modindices(attitude_model.est)
#check the largest modification indices to see if the expected parameter changes are large enough to justify any additional parameters in the  model
```

The above code shows you the steps you should run through for the attitudes construct. You should repeat these steps for each of:  

+ attitudes  
+ subjective norms  
+ perceived behavioural control  
+ intentions  
+ behaviour

`r msmbstyle::question_begin(header="&#x25BA; Question 3a")`
Using lavaan syntax, specify a structural equation model that corresponds to the model in Figure \@ref(fig:tpb); however, for each construct use a latent variable measured by the corresponding items in the dataset
`r msmbstyle::question_end()` 
`r msmbstyle::solution_begin(hidden=HIDDEN_SOLS)`
```{r specify TPB model}
TPB_model<-'
#measurement models for attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control
  
  att=~attitude1+attitude2+attitude3+attitude4
  SN=~SN1+SN2+SN3+SN4
  PBC=~PBC1+PBC2+PBC3+PBC4
  intent=~int1+int2+int3+int4
  beh=~beh1+beh2+beh3+beh4

#regressions  

  beh~intent+PBC
  intent~att+SN+PBC

#covariances between attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control
  
  att~~SN    
  att~~PBC
  SN~~PBC'

```
`r msmbstyle::solution_end()`
---
`r msmbstyle::question_begin(header="&#x25BA; Question 3b")`
Estimate the model from Q2a and evaluate the model  

+ Does the model fit well?  
+ Are the hypothesised paths significant?  

`r msmbstyle::question_end()` 
`r msmbstyle::solution_begin(hidden=HIDDEN_SOLS)`

We can estimate the model using the `sem()` function.  
By default the `sem()` function will scale the latent variables by fixing the loading of the first item for each latent variable to 1 but we can override this by setting `std.lv=T` if we wanted to. By default, maximum likelihood estimation will be used.

```{r estimate TPB_model}
TPB_model.est<-sem(TPB_model, data=TPB_data, std.lv=T)

summary(TPB_model.est, fit.measures=T, standardized=T)
```

We can see that the model fits well according to RMSEA, SRMR, TLI and CFI. All of the hypothesised paths in the theory of planned behaviour are statistically significant.
`r msmbstyle::solution_end()`
---
`r msmbstyle::question_begin(header="&#x25BA; Question 3c")`
Examine the modification indices and expected parameter changes - are there any additional parameters you would consider including?  
`r msmbstyle::question_end()` 
`r msmbstyle::solution_begin(hidden=HIDDEN_SOLS)`

```{r modindices}
modindices(TPB_model.est)
```

In this case, none of the expected parameter changes are large enough that we would consider including any additional parameters
`r msmbstyle::solution_end()`
---
`r msmbstyle::question_begin(header="&#x25BA; Question 3d")`
Test the indirect effect of attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control on behaviour via intentions.  

When you fit the model with `sem()`, use `se='bootstrap'` to get boostrapped standard errors (it may take a few minutes).  
When you inspect the model using `summary()`, get the 95% confidence intervals for parameters with `ci = TRUE`. 
`r msmbstyle::question_end()` 
`r msmbstyle::solution_begin(hidden=HIDDEN_SOLS)`
To test these indirect effects we create new a parameter for each indirect effect:

```{r indirect effects}
TPB_model2<-'
#measurement models for attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control
  
  att=~attitude1+attitude2+attitude3+attitude4
  SN=~SN1+SN2+SN3+SN4
  PBC=~PBC1+PBC2+PBC3+PBC4
  intent=~int1+int2+int3+int4
  beh=~beh1+beh2+beh3+beh4

#regressions  

  beh~b*intent+PBC
  intent~a1*att+a2*SN+a3*PBC

##covariances between attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control
  att~~SN    
  att~~PBC
  SN~~PBC


ind1:=a1*b  #indirect effect of attitudes via intentions
ind2:=a2*b  #indirect effect of subjective norms via intentions
ind3:=a3*b  #indirect effect of perceived behavioural control via intentions
'

```

When we estimate the model, we request boostrapped standard errors: 

```{r estimate model 2}
TPB_model2.est<-sem(TPB_model2, se='bootstrap', data=TPB_data)
```

When we inspect the model, we request the 95% confidence intervals for parameters: 

```{r summarise model 2}
summary(TPB_model2.est, fit.measures=T, standardized=T, ci=T)

```

We can see that all of the indirect effects are statistically significant at p<.05 as none of the 95% confidence intervals for the coefficients include zero.

Write up your analysis as if you were presenting the work in academic paper, with brief separate 'Method' and 'Results' sections
`r msmbstyle::question_end()` 
`r msmbstyle::solution_begin(hidden=HIDDEN_SOLS)`
An example write up would be as follows:

**Method**

We tested a theory of planned behaviour model of physical activity by fitting a structural equation model in which attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control, intentions and behaviour were latent variables defined by four items. We first tested the measurement models for each construct by fitting a one-factor CFA model.  Latent variable scaling was by fixing the loading of the first item for each construct to 1. Models were judged to fit well if $CFI$ and $TLI$ were $>.95$ and $RMSEA$ and $SRMR$ were $<.05$. 

Within the SEM, behaviour was regressed on intentions and perceived behavioural control and intentions were regressed on attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioiural control. In addition, attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control were allowed to covary. The indirect effects of attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control on behaviour were calculated as the product of the effect of the relevant predictor on the mediator (intentions) and the effect of the mediator on the outcome. The statistical significance of the indirect effects were evaluated using bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals with 1000 resamples.

In all cases models were fit using maximum likelihood estimation and model fit was judged to be good if CFI and TLI were $>.95$ and RMSEA and SRMR were $<.05$. Modification indices and expected parameter changes were inspected to identify any areas of local mis-fit but model modifications were only made if they could be justified on substantive grounds.

**Results**

All measurement models fit well ($CFI$ and $TLI >.95$ and $RMSEA$ and $SRMR <.05$). The full structural equation model also fit well ($CFI = 1.00$, $TLI = 1.00$, $RMSEA <.001$, $SRMR = 0.023$). Unstandardised parameter estimates are provided in Table  1. All of the hypothesised paths  were statistically significant at $p<.05$. The significant indirect effects suggested that intentions mediate the effects of attitudes, subjective norms, and  perceived behavioural control on behaviour whilst perceived behavioural control also has a direct effect on behaviour. Results thus provide support for a theory of planned behaviour model of physical activity.
