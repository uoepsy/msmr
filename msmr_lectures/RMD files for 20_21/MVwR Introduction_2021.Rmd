# Other

- Weekly digest will be posted to remind you of your goals/activities for the week

# Course content - first block

- First five weeks will be **mixed effects models**
    - AKA *multilevel models*, *random coefficient models*, *hierarchical models*, *mixed models*
    - Taught by Dan Mirman

# Week 6
- Then a one week ~~break~~ reading week

![](D:/Teaching and Supervision/Psychology/MVwR_1920/break.jpg){width=50%}

# Course content - second block

- Last five weeks will be *dimension reduction* and *latent variable modeling*
    - This will include:
      - Principal components analysis
      - Exploratory factor analysis
      - Confirmatory factor analysis
      - Path analysis
      - Full structural equation modeling
    - Taught by Aja Murray


# The assignment - overview

- 80% report, 20% quizzes
- Quizzes
  - 2 for each part of the course
  - Mark based on best of 3
- Report
  - Similar to USMR
  - Will draw on both sections of the course
  - We will give you data and a series of research questions to answer
  - Answers written up as a report, with R scripts submitted separately
  - More advice to follow later

# The assignment - what we'll be looking for

- Can you select an appropriate method(s) to answer a research question?
- Are your choices well-justified?
- Can you correctly implement these methods in R?
- Can you interpret your findings?

# Assignment dates

- Assignment released on: 2/04/2020
- Assignment due date: 30/04/2020

# How to study

- Watch the lecture recordings
- Ask questions at the Q&As and on discussion forum
  - (there are no stupid questions!) 
- Come to the drop-in sessions
- Build up annotated R scripts
- Engage with the suggested readings
- Use Google and the R help functions
    - even the most experienced coders use both *all the time*

# End

- Enjoy the course!
