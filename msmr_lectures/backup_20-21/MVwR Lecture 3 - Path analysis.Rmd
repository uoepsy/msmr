## What is path analysis?
<center>
![](D:/Teaching and Supervision/Psychology/MVwR_1920/Draft Lectures/footpath.jpg)
</center>
- Links several regression models together
- Tests the set of regression models as a whole
- Useful for situations where there are multiple outcome variables in sequence or parallel
- Models the relations between observed variables (i.e., does not involve latent variables)
- Common example: **path mediation model**

## Mediation

- Is when a predictor X, has an effect on an outcome Y, via a mediating variable M
- The mediator **transmits** the effect of X  to Y 
- Examples of mediation hypotheses:
    - Conscientiousness (X) affects health (Y) via health behaviours (M)
    - Conduct problems (X) increase the risk of depression (Y) via peer problems (M)
    - Attitudes to smoking (X) predict intentions to smoke (M) which in turn predicts smoking behaviour (Y) 
    - An intervention (X) to reduce youth crime (Y) works by increasing youth self-contol (M)
    
## Visualising a mediation model

- In a SEM diagram we can represent mediation as:

    </center>


## Mediation... not to be confused with moderation
<center>
![](D:/Teaching and Supervision/Psychology/MVwR_1920/Draft Lectures/confused.png){width=30%}
</center>
- Mediation is commonly confused with **moderation** 
- Moderation is when a moderator z modifies the effect of X on Y
    - e.g., the effect of X on Y is stronger at higher levels of Z
- Also known as an **interaction** between X and Z
- Examples of moderation could be:
    - An intervention (X) works better to reduce bullying (Y) at older ages (Z) of school pupil
    - The relation between stress (X) and depression (Y) is lower for those scoring higher on spirituality (Z) 
    

## Direct and indirect effects in mediation

- We seldom hypothesise that a mediator completely explains the relation between X and Y
- More commonly, we expect both **indirect effects** and **direct effects** of X on Y
    - The indirect effects of X on Y are those transmitted via the mediator
    - The direct effect of X on Y is the remaining effect of X on Y

## Testing mediation

![](D:/Teaching and Supervision/Psychology/MVwR_1920/Draft Lectures/trad med.png){width=50%}

</center>
- Traditionally, mediation was tested using a series of separate regression models:
    1) Y~X  
    2) Y~X+M  
    3) M~X
    
    
## Traditional methods of testing mediation

- The three regression models:
    1) Y~X  
    2) Y~X+M  
    3) M~X
    
    
    
- Model 1 estimates the overall effect of X on Y
- Model 2 estimates the partial effects of X and M on Y
- Model 3 estimates the effect of X on M

- If the following conditions were met, mediation was assumed to hold:
    - The effect of X on Y (eq.1) is significant
    - The effect of X on M (eq.3) is significant
    - The effect of X on Y becomes reduced when M is added into the model (eq.2)
    
    
## Limitations of traditional methods of testing mediation
<center>
![](D:/Teaching and Supervision/Psychology/MVwR_1920/Draft Lectures/Sadface.jpg){width=20%}
</center>
- Low power
- Very cumbersome for multiple mediators, predictors, or outcomes
- You don't get an estimate of the magnitude of the indirect effect
- Much better way: **path mediation model**


## Testing a path mediation model in lavaan

- Specification
    - Create a lavaan syntax object
- Estimation
    - Estimate the model using e.g., maximum likelihood estimation
- Evaluation/interpretation
  - Inspect the model to judge how good it is
  - Interpret the parameter estimates

    
## Example

<center>
![](D:/Teaching and Supervision/Psychology/MVwR_1920/Draft Lectures/aggression2.png){width=20%}
</center>

- Does peer rejection mediate the association between aggression and depression?

```{r peer rejection example simulate data, include=F}
library(lavaan)
agg.PR.dep<-'Dep~0.3*PR
             Dep~0.2*Agg
             PR~0.5*Agg'

agg.data2<-simulateData(model=agg.PR.dep, standardized = T, model.type='sem')
  
```

<center>
![](D:/Teaching and Supervision/Psychology/MVwR_1920/Draft Lectures/Mediation diagram example.png){width=50%}
</center>

## The data
```{r example 1 descriptives}
library(psych)
describe(agg.data2)
#PR = peer rejection, Agg= aggression, Dep= depression
```


  
## Mediation example

- Does peer rejection mediate the association between aggression and depression?

 ```{r peer rejection example}

#Create the model syntax

model1<-'Dep~PR      # Depression predicted by peer rejection
         Dep~Agg     # Depression predicted by aggression (the direct effect)
         PR~Agg      # Peer rejection predicted by aggression'     


#estimate the model 

model1.est<-sem(model1, data=agg.data2)
```

## The model output
```{r inspect model output}
summary(model1.est, fit.measures=T)

```

## Things to note from the model output

- All three regressions paths are statistically significant
- The model is **just-identified**
    - The degrees of freedom are equal to 0
    - The model fit cannot be tested
    - The model fit statistics (TLI, CFI, RMSEA, SRMR) all suggest perfect fit but this is meaningless


## Visualising the model

- We can use semPaths() from the semPlot package to help us visualise the model
    - Shows the parameter estimates within an SEM diagram

```{r visualise model output}
library(semPlot)
semPaths(model1.est, what='est')
```

## Calculating the indirect effects 
<center>
![](D:/Teaching and Supervision/Psychology/MVwR_1920/Draft Lectures/Mediation diagram example a b.png){width=50%}
</center>

- To calculate the indirect effect of X on Y in path mediation, we need to create some new parameters
- The indirect effect of X on Y via M is:
    - $a*b$
    - $a$ = the regression coefficient for M~X
    - $b$ = the regression coefficient for Y~M

## Calculating indirect effects in lavaan

- To calculate the indirect effect of X on Y in lavaan we:
    - Use parameter labels 'a' and 'b' to label the relevant paths
        - a is for the effect of X on M
        - b is for the effect of M on Y
    - Use the ':=' operator to create a new parameter 'ind'
        - 'ind' represents our indirect effect

```{r indirect effects}
  model1<-'Dep~b*PR     # Add b label here     
           Dep~Agg     
           PR~a*Agg     # Add a label here    
           
ind:=a*b                # create a new parameter ind which is the product of a and b'    
```

## Indirect effects in the output

```{r indirect effects output}

model1.est<-sem(model1, data=agg.data2)
summary(model1.est)

```

## Statistical significance of the indirect effects

- Default method of assessing the statistical significance of indirect effects assume normal sampling distribution
- May not hold for indirect effects which are the product of regression coefficients
- Instead we can use **bootstrapping**
    - Provides an estimate of the sampling variance of a coefficient based on the actual data 
      - as opposed to a theoretical sampling distribution 
    - Resamples with replacement repeatedly from the observed data
    - Calculates the sampling variance based on variation of the coefficient across resamples
      - Number of resamples usually between 1000 and 10000
    - Allows 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to be computed
    - If 95% CI includes 0, the indirect effect is not significant at alpha=.05
    
## Bootstapped CIs for indirect effect in lavaan

```{r indirect effects with bootstrapped CIs}
  model1<-'Dep~b*PR          
           Dep~Agg     
           PR~a*Agg      
ind:=a*b'    

model1.est<-sem(model1, data=agg.data2, se='bootstrap') #we add the argument se='bootstrap'


```

## Output for bootstrapped CIs for an indirect effect in lavaan

```{r indirect effect with bootstrapped CIs output}
summary(model1.est, ci=T) # we add the argument ci=T to see the confidence intervals in the output
```

## Total effects in path mediation

- As well as the direct and indirect effect, it is often of interest to know the **total** effect of X on Y
$$Total   = Indirect + Direct  $$

## Total effects in path mediation

<center>
![](D:/Teaching and Supervision/Psychology/MVwR_1920/Draft Lectures/Mediation diagram example a b c.png){width=50%}
</center>
$$Total = a*b + c$$

## Total effect in lavaan



```{r total effects}
  model1<-'Dep~b*PR          
           Dep~c*Agg         # we add the label c for our direct effect    
           PR~a*Agg      
ind:=a*b
total:=a*b+c                 # we add a new parameter for the total effect'    

model1.est<-sem(model1, data=agg.data2, se='bootstrap') #we add the argument se='bootstrap'

```

## Total effect in lavaan output

```{r total effect output}

summary(model1.est, ci=T)

```

## Why code the total effect in lavaan?

- We could have just added up the coefficients for the direct and indirect effects
- By coding it in lavaan, however, we can assess the statistical significance of the total effect
- Useful because sometimes the direct and indirect effects are not individually significant but the total effect is
    - May be especially relevant in cases where there are many mediators of small effect

## Interpreting the total, direct, and indirect effect coefficients

- The total effect can be interpreted as the *unit increase in Y expected to occur when X increases by one unit*
- The indirect effect can be interpreted as the *unit increase in Y expected to occur via M when X increases by one unit*
- The direct effect can be interpreted as the *unit increase in Y expected to occur with a unit increase in X over and above the increase transmitted by M*
    - Note: 'direct' effect may not actually be direct - it may be acting via other mediators not included in our model

## Standardised parameters

- As with CFA models, standardised parameters can be obtained using:

```{r stand param}

summary(model1.est, ci=T, standardized=T)
```


## Reporting path mediation models 

- Methods
  - The model being tested
  - e.g. 'Y was regressed on both X and M and M was regressed on X'
  - The estimator used (e.g., maximum likelihood estimation)
  - The method used to test the significance of indirect effects ('bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals')
- Results
  - Model fit (for over-identified models)
  - The parameter estimates for the path mediation  and their statistical significance
    - Can be useful to present these in a SEM diagram
    - Helps reader better visualise the model
    - The diagrams from R not considered 'publication quality' - draw in powerpoint or similar

</center>

Note. *=significant at p<.05

- Include the key parameter estimates
- Indicate statistically significant paths (e.g. with an '*')
- Include a figure note that explains how statistically significant paths (and at what level) are signified 

## Reporting path mediation models - the indirect effects
- Results
  - The coefficient for the indirect effect and the bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals
  - Common to also report **proportion mediation**:
  
  $$\frac{indirect}{total}$$ 
  
- However, important to be aware of limitations:
    - Big proportion mediation possible when total effect is small - makes effect seem more impressive
    - Small proportion mediation even when total effect is big - can underplay importance of effect
    - Should be interpreted in context of total effect
- Tricky interpretation if there are a mix of negative and positive effects involved

## Extensions of path mediation models

- We can extend our path mediation model in various ways:
    - Several mediators in sequence or parallel
    - Multiple outcomes
    - Multiple predictors
    - Multiple groups
      (e.g., comparing direct and indirect effects across males and females)
    - Add covariates to adjust for potential confounders

    
## Example: multiple mediation model
<center>
![](D:/Teaching and Supervision/Psychology/MVwR_1920/Draft Lectures/Mediation diagram example multiple mediation.png){width=50%}

</center>
```{r mult med}
model2<-'Dep~b2*Aca  
         Aca~a2*Agg
         
         Dep~b1*PR
         PR~a1*Agg
         
         Dep~c*Agg  # direct effect

ind1:=a1*b1
ind2:=a2*b2
total=a1*b1+a2*b2+c'

```

## Other path analysis models

- Path mediation models are a common application of path models
- But they are just one example
- Anything that can be expressed in terms of regressions between observed variables can be tested as a path model
- Can include ordinal or binary variables
- Can include moderation
- Other common path analysis models include:
    - Autoregressive models for longitudinal data
    - Cross-lagged panel models for longitudinal data


## Other path analysis models - AR

- autoregressive models to examine the stability of a construct over time

![](D:/Teaching and Supervision/Psychology/MVwR_1920/Draft Lectures/autoregressive.png){width=50%}

```{r AR}

##creating a lavaan syntax object for an autoregressive model

Autoregressive<-'AggT3~AggT2
                 AggT2~AggT1'
```

## Other path analysis models - CLPM

- cross-lagged panel models to examine the relations between constructs over time
    - autoregressive paths  control for previous levels of each construct
    - cross-lagged paths capture the relations between the two constructs
<center>
![](D:/Teaching and Supervision/Psychology/MVwR_1920/Draft Lectures/CLPM.png){width=50%}
</center>
```{r CLPM}

# creating a lavaan syntax object for a CLPM
CLPM<-'AggT3~AggT2+DepT2
       AggT2~AggT1+DepT1
       DepT3~DepT2+AggT2
       DepT2~DepT1+AggT1'
```

## Other path analysis  models - CLPM with mediation

- longitudinal mediation models using a cross-lagged panel model
<center>
![](D:/Teaching and Supervision/Psychology/MVwR_1920/Draft Lectures/CLPM mediation.png){width=50%}
</center>
```{r CLPM with mediation}

#creating a lavaan syntax object for a longitudinal mediation model

CLPM.med<-'AggT3~AggT2+DepT2+PRT2  
           AggT2~AggT1+DepT1+PRT1
           DepT3~DepT2+AggT2+b*PRT2   # label the effect of M on Y as b
           DepT2~DepT1+AggT1+PRT1     
           PRT3~PRT2+AggT2+DepT2
           PRT2~PRT1+a*AggT1+DepT1    # label the effect of X on M as a

ind:=a*b'
```
           
## Making model modifications

- As in CFA models, you *may* want to make some modifications to your initially hypothesised model 
    - non-significant paths that you want to trim
    - include some additional paths not initially included
- Remember that this now moves us into exploratory territory where:
    - Model modifications should be substantively as well as statistically justifiable
    - You must be aware of the possibility that you are capitalising on chance
    - You should aim to replicate the modifications in independent data


## Cautions regarding path analysis models

- **Assumption** that the paths represent causal effects is only an assumption
    - Especially if using cross-sectional data
- The parameters are only accurate if the model is correctly specified


## Cautions regarding path analysis models - indistinguishable models
<center>
![](D:/Teaching and Supervision/Psychology/MVwR_1920/Draft Lectures/med versus confounding.png){width=50%}
</center>
## Measurement error in path analysis

- Path analysis models use observed variables
- Assumes no measurement error in these variables
- Path coefficients likely to be attenuated due to unmodelled measurement error
- Structural equation models solve this issue
- They are path analysis models where the paths are between latent rather than observed variables
- ...more on this next week



## Path analysis summary

- Path analysis can be used to fit sets of regression models
    - Common path analysis model is the path mediation model
    - But very flexible - huge range of models that can be tested
- In R, path analysis can be done using the sem( ) function in lavaan
- Need to be aware that we aren't *testing* causality but assuming it
