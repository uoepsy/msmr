# Non-convergence and singular fits: what should I do? 

## Singular fits

You may have noticed that a lot of our models over the last few weeks have been giving a warning: `boundary (singular) fit: see ?isSingular`.   
Up to now, we've been largely ignoring these warnings. However, this week we're going to look at how to deal with this issue.

The warning is telling us that our model has resulted in a 'singular fit'. Singular fits often indicate that the model is 'overfitted' - that is, the random effects structure which we have specified is too complex to be supported by the data.  

Perhaps the most intuitive advice would be remove the most complex part of the random effects structure (i.e. random slopes). This leads to a simpler model that is not over-fitted. In other words, start simplying from the top (where the most complexity is) to the bottom (where the lowest complexity is).
Additionally, when variance estimates are very low for a specific random effect term, this indicates that the model is not estimating this parameter to differ much between the levels of your grouping variable. It might, in some experimental designs, be perfectly acceptable to remove this or simply include it as a fixed effect.

A key point here is that when fitting a mixed model, we should think about how the data are generated. Asking yourself questions such as "do we have good reason to assume subjects might vary over time, or to assume that they will have different starting points (i.e., different intercepts)?" can help you in specifying your random effect structure

You can read in depth about what this means by reading the help documentation for `?isSingular`. For our purposes, a relevant section is copied below:  

*... intercept-only models, or 2-dimensional random effects such as intercept + slope models, singularity is relatively easy to detect because it leads to random-effect variance estimates of (nearly) zero, or estimates of correlations that are (almost) exactly -1 or 1.*


## Convergence warnings

Issues of non-convergence can be caused by many things. If you're model doesn't converge, it does *not necessarily* mean the fit is incorrect, however it is **is cause for concern**, and should be addressed, else you may end up reporting inferences which do not hold.

There are lots of different things which you could do which *might* help your model to converge. A select few are detailed below:  

- double-check the model specification and the data  

- adjust stopping (convergence) tolerances for the nonlinear optimizer, using the optCtrl argument to [g]lmerControl. (see `?convergence` for convergence controls). 
    - What is "tolerance"? Remember that our optimizer is the the method by which the computer finds the best fitting model, by iteratively assessing and trying to maximise the likelihood (or minimise the loss). 
    ```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="An optimizer will stop after a certain number of iterations, or when it meets a tolerance threshold"}
    knitr::include_graphics("images/otherranef/tolerance.png")
    ```

- center and scale continuous predictor variables (e.g. with `scale`)  

- Change the optimization method (for example, here we change it to `bobyqa`):
    `lmer(..., control = lmerControl(optimizer="bobyqa"))`  
    `glmer(..., control = glmerControl(optimizer="bobyqa"))`  

- Increase the number of optimization steps:
    `lmer(..., control = lmerControl(optimizer="bobyqa", optCtrl=list(maxfun=50000))`  
    `glmer(..., control = glmerControl(optimizer="bobyqa", optCtrl=list(maxfun=50000))`  

- Use `allFit()` to try the fit with all available optimizers. This will of course be slow, but is considered 'the gold standard'; *"if all optimizers converge to values that are practically equivalent, then we would consider the convergence warnings to be false positives."*

# Random effects

When specifying a random effects model, think about the data you have and how they fit in the following table:

| Criterion: | Repetition: <br> _If the experiment were repeated:_ | Desired inference: <br> _The conclusions refer to:_                   |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Fixed effects  | Same levels would be used                        | The levels used                                                    |
| Random effects | Different levels would be used                   | A population from which the levels used are just a (random) sample |

For example, applying the criteria to the following questions:

- Do dogs learn faster with higher rewards? 

  FIXED: reward
  
  RANDOM: dog

- Do students read faster at higher temperatures?

  FIXED: temperature
  
  RANDOM: student

- Does people speaking one language speak faster than another?

  FIXED: the language
  
  RANDOM: the people speaking that language

<br>

Sometimes, after simplifying the model, you find that there isn't much variability in a specific random effect and, if it still leads to singular fits or convergence warnings, it is common to just model that variable as a fixed effect. 

Other times, you don't have sufficient data or levels to estimate the random effect variance, and you are forced to model it as a fixed effect.
This is similar to trying to find the "best-fit" line passing through a single point... You can't because you need two points!

## Random effects in lme4  

Below are a selection of different formulas for specifying different random effect structures, taken from the [lme4 vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/vignettes/lmer.pdf). This might look like a lot, but over time and repeated use of multilevel models you will get used to reading these in a similar way to getting used to reading the formula structure of `y ~ x1 + x2` in all our linear models. 
<br>

|  Formula|  Alternative|  Meaning|
|--------:|------------:|--------:|
|  $\text{(1 | g)}$|  $\text{1 + (1 | g)}$|  Random intercept with fixed mean|
|  $\text{0 + offset(o) + (1 | g)}$|  $\text{-1 + offset(o) + (1 | g)}$|  Random intercept with *a priori* means|
|  $\text{(1 | g1/g2)}$|  $\text{(1 | g1) + (1 | g1:g2)}$|  Intercept varying among $g1$ and $g2$ within $g1$|
|  $\text{(1 | g1) + (1 | g2)}$|  $\text{1 + (1 | g1) + (1 | g2)}$|  Intercept varying among $g1$ and $g2$|
|  $\text{x + (x | g)}$|  $\text{1 + x + (1 + x | g)}$|  Correlated random intercept and slope|
|  $\text{x + (x || g)}$|  $\text{1 + x + (x | g) + (0 + x | g)}$|  Uncorrelated random intercept and slope|
**Table 1:** Examples of the right-hand-sides of mixed effects model formulas. $g$, $g1$, $g2$ are grouping factors, covariates and *a priori* known offsets are $x$ and $o$.


# A. Three-level nesting

`r optbegin("Data Codebook: Treatment effects", olabel=FALSE, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
  
Synthetic data from a RCT treatment study: 5 therapists randomly assigned participants to control or treatment group and monitored the participants' performance over time. There was a baseline test, then 6 weeks of treatment, with test sessions every week (7 total sessions).

The following code will load in your R session an object already called `tx` with the data:  

```{r}
load(url("https://uoepsy.github.io/msmr/data/tx.Rdata"))
```

You can see the head of the data below: 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
head(tx) %>%
  kable(digits = 2, align = 'c') %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
```

`r optend()`

`r qbegin(1)`
Load and visualise the data. Does it look like the treatment had an effect on the performance score?
`r qend()` 
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
```{r message=FALSE}
ggplot(tx, aes(session, Score, color=group)) +
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_se, geom="pointrange") +
  stat_smooth() +
  theme_classic()
```

Just for fun, let's add on the individual participant scores, and also make a plot for each therapist. 
```{r message=FALSE}
ggplot(tx, aes(session, Score, color=group)) +
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_se, geom = "pointrange") +
  stat_smooth() +
  theme_classic() +
  geom_line(aes(group = PID), alpha = .2) + 
  facet_wrap(~ therapist)
```
`r solend()` 



`r qbegin(2)`
Consider these questions when you're designing your model(s) and use your answers to motivate your model design and interpretation of results:  

a. What are the levels of nesting? How should that be reflected in the random effect structure?
a. What is the shape of change over time? Do you need polynomials to model this shape? If yes, what order polynomials?
`r qend()` 
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
a. There are repeated measures of participants (session). There are also repeated measures of therapists (each one treated many participants).
a. Looks like linear change, don't need polynomials. Good to know that there is no difference at baseline, so no need for orthogonal time.
`r solend()` 



`r qbegin(3)`
Test whether the treatment had an effect using mixed-effects modelling.  

Try to fit the **maximal** model.  
Does it converge? Is it singular?

`r optbegin("Hint: What *is* the maximal model?", olabel=FALSE, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

There's an interaction between session and group. Each participant has several sessions, so we want `(1 + session | PID)` and each therapist has several groups and sessions, so we want `(1 + ? * ? | ?)`

`r optend()`

`r qend()` 
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
```{r}
library(lme4)
library(lmerTest)

# start with maximal model
m1 <- lmer(Score ~ session * group + 
             (1 + session | PID) + 
             (1 + session * group | therapist),
           data=tx, REML=FALSE)

isSingular(m1)
```

`r solend()` 



`r qbegin(4)`
Try adjusting your model by removing random effects or correlations, examine the model again, and so on..  
`r qend()` 
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
```{r}
VarCorr(m1)
```
There's a correlation of exactly -1 between the random intercepts and slopes for therapists, and the standard deviation estimate for `session|therapist` is pretty small. Let's remove it. 
```{r}
m2 <- lmer(Score ~ session * group + 
             (1 + session | PID) + 
             (1 | therapist),
           data=tx, REML=FALSE)
VarCorr(m2)
```
It now looks like estimates for random intercepts for therapists is now 0. If we remove this, our model finally is non-singular:
```{r}
m3 <- lmer(Score ~ session * group + 
             (1 + session | PID),
           data=tx, REML=FALSE)
summary(m3)
```
Lastly, it's then a good idea to check that the parameter estimates and SE are not radically different across these models (they are virtually identical)
```{r}
summary(m1)$coefficients
summary(m2)$coefficients
summary(m3)$coefficients
```
`r solend()` 



`r qbegin('Extra: Question 5', FALSE)`

Try the code below to use the `allFit()` function to fit your final model with all the available optimizers.^[If you have an older version of `lme4`, then `allFit()` might not be directly available, and you will need to run the following: `source(system.file("utils", "allFit.R", package="lme4"))`.]  
  
+ You might need to install the `dfoptim` package to get one of the optimizers  


```{r eval=FALSE}
sumfits <- allFit(yourmodel)
summary(sumfits)
```
`r qend()` 


# B. Crossed random effects

`r optbegin("Data Codeook: Test-enhanced learning",olabel=FALSE, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

An experiment was run to replicate "test-enhanced learning" (Roediger & Karpicke, 2006): two groups of 25 participants were presented with material to learn. One group studied the material twice (`StudyStudy`), the other group studied the material once then did a test (`StudyTest`). Recall was tested immediately (one minute) after the learning session and one week later. The recall tests were composed of 175 items identified by a keyword (`Test_word`).  

The critical (replication) prediction is that the `StudyStudy` group should perform somewhat better on the immediate recall test, but the `StudyTest` group will retain the material better and thus perform better on the 1-week follow-up test.

The following code loads the data into your R environment by creating a variable called `tel`:
```{r}
load(url("https://uoepsy.github.io/msmr/data/TestEnhancedLearning.RData"))
```

The head of the dataset can be seen below:
```{r echo=FALSE}
head(tel) %>%
  kable(digits = 2, align = 'c') %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
```

`r optend()`


`r qbegin(6)`
Load and plot the data. Does it look like the effect was replicated?
`r qend()` 
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
You can make use of `stat_summary()` again!
```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(tel, aes(Delay, Correct, col=Group)) + 
  stat_summary(fun.data=mean_se, geom="pointrange")+
  theme_light()
```
It's more work, but some people might rather calculate the numbers and then plot them directly. It does just the same thing: 
```{r}
tel %>% 
  group_by(Delay, Group) %>%
  summarise(
    mean = mean(Correct),
    se = sd(Correct)/sqrt(n())
  ) %>%
  ggplot(., aes(x=Delay, col = Group)) +
  geom_pointrange(aes(y=mean, ymin=mean-se, ymax=mean+se))+
  theme_light() +
  labs(y = "Correct")
```
  
That looks like test-enhanced learning to me!  
`r solend()` 



`r qbegin(7)`
Test the critical hypothesis using a mixed-effects model. Fit the maximal random effect structure supported by the experimental design.  

Some questions to consider:  
  
+ Item accuracy is a binary variable. What kind of model will you use?  
+ We can expect variability across subjects (some people are better at learning than others) and across items (some of the recall items are harder than others). How should this be represented in the random effects?

+ If a model takes ages to fit, you might want to cancel it by pressing the escape key. It is normal for complex models to take time, but for the purposes of this task, give up after a couple of minutes, and try simplifying your model.  

`r qend()` 
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
This one will probably take too long:
```{r eval=FALSE}
m <- glmer(Correct ~ Delay*Group +
             (1 + Delay | Subject_ID) +
             (1 + Delay * Group | Test_word),
           data=tel, family="binomial",
           glmerControl(optimizer = "bobyqa"))
```
So lets remove the interaction in the by-word random effects:
```{r}
m <- glmer(Correct ~ Delay*Group +
             (1 + Delay | Subject_ID) +
             (1 + Delay + Group | Test_word),
           data=tel, family="binomial",
           glmerControl(optimizer = "bobyqa"))
summary(m)
```

`r solend()` 

`r qbegin(8)`
The model with maximal random effects will probably not converge, or will obtain a singular fit. Simplify the model until you achieve convergence.  
<br>
What we're aiming to do here is to follow [Barr et al.'s](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jml.2012.11.001) advice of defining our maximal model and then removing only the terms to allow a non-singular fit.  
<br>
**Note:** This strategy - starting with the maximal random effects structure and removing terms until obtaining model convergence, is just *one* approach, and there are drawbacks (see [Matuschek et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jml.2017.01.001)). There is no consensus on what approach is best (see `?isSingular`).  
<br>
<br>
*Tip:* you can look at the variance estimates and correlations easily by using the `VarCorr()` function. What jumps out?  
<br>
*Hint:* Generalization over subjects could be considered more important than over items - if the estimated variance of slopes for `Delay` and `Group` by-items are comparatively small, it might be easier to remove them?  
`r qend()` 
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
```{r}
VarCorr(m)
```
The by-item slope of `Group` seems to be quite highly correlated with other by-item terms.   

For now, we will just simply remove the term (however, we could - if we had theoretical justification - constrain our model so that there was 0 correlation)
```{r}
m2 <- glmer(Correct ~ Delay*Group +
             (1 + Delay | Subject_ID) +
             (1 + Delay | Test_word),
            data=tel, family="binomial",
            glmerControl(optimizer = "bobyqa"))
VarCorr(m2)
```

It's still a singular fit, and the `Delay` random slope by `Test_word` variance is extremely low and perfectly correlated with the intercept, let's try removing that:
```{r}
m3 <- glmer(Correct ~ Delay*Group +
              (1 + Delay | Subject_ID) +
              (1 | Test_word),
            data=tel, family="binomial",
            glmerControl(optimizer = "bobyqa"))
```
Hooray, the model converged! 
```{r}
summary(m3)
```
`r solend()` 

<!-- You can also get some odds-ratios and quick confidence intervals using the following: -->
<!-- *Note, the `method = "Wald"` corresponds to a quick-and-easy method of calculating confidence intervals (simply $1.96 \times SE$). The gold standard for confidence intervals is `method = "boot"`, which obtains them via bootstrapping, but this will take too long!  -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- exp(fixef(m4)) -->
<!-- exp(confint(m4, method="Wald"))[8:11,] -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- No difference between groups on the immediate test.  -->
<!-- For the `StudyStudy` group, there was a decreased likelihood of getting an item correct on the follow-up test relative to the immediate test ($OR = 0.35, \text{95% CI} = [0.31, 0.40]$).   -->
<!-- For the The likelihood of correctly answering an item  -->

`r qbegin(9)`
Load the **effects** package, and try running this code:
```{r}
library(effects)
ef <- as.data.frame(effect("Delay:Group", m3))
```

What is `ef`? and how can you use it to plot the model-estimated condition means and variability?

`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

```{r}
ggplot(ef, aes(Delay, fit, color=Group)) + 
  geom_pointrange(aes(ymax=upper, ymin=lower), position=position_dodge(width = 0.2))+
  theme_classic() # just for a change :)
```


`r solend()`

`r solend()` 

`r qbegin(10)`
What should we do with this information? How can we apply test-enhanced learning to learning R and statistics?
`r qend()` 
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
You'll get the benefits of test-enhanced learning if you try yourself before looking at the solutions! If you don't test yourself, you're more likely to forget it in the long run.
