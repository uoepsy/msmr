# Recap of multilevel models

> Do children scores in maths improve more in school 2020 vs school 2040?

Consider the following data, representing longitudinal measurements on 10 students from an urban public primary school. The outcome of interest is mathematics achievement. 
The data were collected at the end of first grade and annually thereafter up to sixth grade, but not all students have six observations. The variable year has been mean-centred to have mean 0 so that results will have as baseline the average.

<br>

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

set.seed(5293)

# egm <- foreign::read.dta("https://data.princeton.edu/pop510/egm.dta")
# 
# data <- tibble(egm) %>%
#     dplyr::select(schoolid, childid, year, math) %>%
#     filter(schoolid %in% c(2020, 2040))

# write_csv(data, file = '../../data/MathsAchievement.csv')

data <- read_csv('https://uoepsy.github.io/data/MathsAchievement.csv')
data$childid <- as.factor(data$childid)
data$schoolid <- as.factor(data$schoolid)
```


```{r echo=FALSE}
data %>%
    DT::datatable(options = list(pageLength = 10)) %>%
    DT::formatRound(columns=c('math'), digits = 2)
```


How many students in each school?
```{r echo=FALSE}
data %>% 
  dplyr::select(schoolid, childid) %>% 
  distinct %>%
  pull(schoolid) %>%
  table(schoolid = .) %>%
  addmargins()
```

We have 42 students, 21 in school with id 2020 and 21 in school with id 2040:

The number of observations per child are as follows.
```{r}
table(data$childid)
```

We can see that for some children we have fewer than the 6 observations: some have 3, 4, or 5.
 

## School 2020

Let's start by considering only the children in school 2020. The mathematics achievement over time is shown, for each student, in the plot below:

```{r fig.height = 6.5, fig.width = 7.5, out.width = '100%'}
data2020 <- data %>% 
  filter(schoolid == 2020)

ggplot(data2020, aes(x = year, y = math)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ childid, labeller = label_both) +
  labs(x = "Year (mean centred)", y = "Maths achievement score")
```

Clearly, the measurements of mathematics achievement related to each student are _grouped data_ as they refer to the same entity.

If we were to ignore this grouping and consider all children as one single population, we would obtain misleading results.The observations for the same student are clearly correlated. Some students consistently have a much better performance than other students, perhaps due to underlying numerical skills.

A fundamental assumption of linear regression models is that the residuals, and hence the data too, should be uncorrelated. In this example this is not the case.

The following plot considers all data as a single population
```{r}
ggplot(data2020, aes(x = year, y = math)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE) +
    labs(x = "Year (mean centred)", y = "Maths achievement score")
```

This is a simple linear regression model for the mathematics measurement of individual $i$ on occasion $j$:
$$
\text{math}_{ij} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \ \text{year}_{ij} + \epsilon_{ij} 
$$

where the subscript $ij$ denotes the $j$th measurement from child $i$.

Let's fit this in R
```{r}
m0 <- lm(math ~ year, data = data2020)
summary(m0)
```

The intercept and slope of this model can be visually represented as:

```{r echo=FALSE}
b0 <- coef(m0)

ggplot(data2020, aes(x = year, y = math)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Year (mean centred)", y = "Maths achievement score") +
  annotate(geom = 'label', x = 0, y = b0[1], label = "beta[0]", 
           parse = TRUE, color = 'red', size = 5) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = 1, xend = 2, 
                   y = b0 %*% c(1, 1), yend = b0 %*% c(1, 1)), col = 'red') +
  geom_segment(aes(x = 2, xend = 2, 
                   y = b0 %*% c(1, 1), yend = b0 %*% c(1, 2)), col = 'red') +
  annotate(geom = 'label', x = 2, y = 1.3, label = "beta[1]", 
           parse = TRUE, color = 'red', hjust = -0.3, size = 5) +
  annotate(geom = 'label', x = 1.4, y = 0.5, label = "1", 
           parse = TRUE, color = 'red', hjust = 0, size = 5)
```


## Random intercept and slopes

In reality, we see that each student has their own line, with a different intercept and slope.
In other words, they all have different values of maths achievement when year =  0 and they also differ in their learning rate.

```{r, fig.height=5}
ggplot(data2020, aes(x = year, y = math, color = childid)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE, fullrange = TRUE, 
                size = 0.5) +
    labs(x = "Year (mean centred)", y = "Maths achievement score") +
    theme(legend.position = 'bottom')
```


Let's now write a model where each student has their own intercept and slope:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{math}_{ij} 
&= \beta_{0i} + \beta_{1i} \ \text{year}_{ij} + \epsilon_{ij} \\
&= (\text{intercept for child } i) + (\text{slope for child } i) \ \text{year}_{ij} + \epsilon_{ij} \\
&= (\gamma_{00} + \zeta_{0i}) + (\gamma_{10} + \zeta_{1i}) \ \text{year}_{ij} + \epsilon_{ij}
\end{aligned}
$$

where

- $\beta_{0i}$ is the intercept of the line for child $i$

- $\beta_{1i}$ is the slope of the line for child $i$

- $\epsilon_{ij}$ are the deviations of each child's measurement $\text{math}_{ij}$ from the line of child $i$

<br>

We can think each child-specific intercept (respectively, slope) as being made up of two components: an "overall" intercept $\gamma_{00}$ (slope $\gamma_{10}$) and a child-specific deviation from the overall intercept $\zeta_{0i}$ (slope $\zeta_{1i}$):

- $\beta_{0i} = \gamma_{00} + \zeta_{0i} = \text{(overall intercept) + (deviation for child }i)$

- $\beta_{1i} = \gamma_{10} + \zeta_{1i} = \text{(overall slope) + (deviation for child }i)$


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/un_lmm.png')
```

:::yellow
**FACT**

**Deviations from the mean average to zero (and sum to zero too!)**

As you know, deviations from the mean average to 0.

This holds for the errors $\epsilon_{ij}$, as well as the deviations $\zeta_{0i}$ from the overall intercept, and the deviations $\zeta_{1i}$ from the overall slope.

Think of data $y_1, ..., y_n$ and their mean $\bar y$. The average of the deviations from the mean is
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\sum_i (y_i - \bar y)}{n} 
= \frac{\sum_i y_i }{n} - \frac{\sum_i \bar y}{n} 
= \bar y - \frac{n * \bar y}{n} 
= \bar y - \bar y 
= 0
\end{aligned}
$$
:::


<br>

The child-specific deviations $\zeta_{0i}$ from the overall intercept are normally distributed with mean $0$ and variance $\sigma_0^2$. Similarly, the deviations $\zeta_{1i}$ of the slope for child $i$ from the overall slope come from a normal distribution with mean $0$ and variance $\sigma_1^2$. The correlation between random intercepts and slopes is $\rho = \text{Cor}(\zeta_{0i}, \zeta_{1i}) = \frac{\sigma_{01}}{\sigma_0 \sigma_1}$:

$$
\begin{bmatrix} \zeta_{0i} \\ \zeta_{1i} \end{bmatrix} 
\sim N
\left(
    \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, 
    \begin{bmatrix} 
        \sigma_0^2 & \rho \sigma_0 \sigma_1 \\
        \rho \sigma_0 \sigma_1 & \sigma_1^2
    \end{bmatrix}
\right)
$$

The random errors, independently from the random effects, are distributed
$$
\epsilon_{ij} \sim N(0, \sigma_\epsilon^2)
$$


This is fitted using `lmer()`:
```{r}
library(lme4)
library(lmerTest)

m1 <- lmer(math ~ 1 + year + (1 + year | childid), data = data2020)
summary(m1)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
b1 <- fixef(m1) %>% round(3)
u1 <- ranef(m1)$childid %>% round(3)
su <- as.data.frame(VarCorr(m1))[, 5] %>% round(3)
s <- sigma(m1) %>% round(3)
```

The summary of the `lmer` output returns estimated values for

Fixed effects:

- $\widehat \gamma_{00} = `r b1[1]`$ 
- $\widehat \gamma_{10} = `r b1[2]`$

Variability of random effects:

- $\widehat \sigma_{0} = `r su[1]`$
- $\widehat \sigma_{1} = `r su[2]`$

Correlation of random effects:

- $\widehat \rho = `r su[3]`$

Residuals:

- $\widehat \sigma_\epsilon = `r su[4]`$


Check normality of random effects:

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height = 4, out.width = '95%'}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
qqnorm(ranef(m1)$childid[, 1], main = "Random intercept")
qqline(ranef(m1)$childid[, 1])

qqnorm(ranef(m1)$childid[, 2], main = "Random slope")
qqline(ranef(m1)$childid[, 2])
```


Check normality and independence of errors:

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height = 4, out.width = '95%'}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
qqnorm(resid(m1), main = "Residuals")
qqline(resid(m1))

plot(fitted(m1), resid(m1), ylab = "Residuals", xlab = "Fitted values")
abline(h=0)
```


Visually inspect the correlation between the random intercept and slopes:

```{r}
ggplot(ranef(m1)$childid,
       aes(x = `(Intercept)`, y = year)) +
    geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE, 
                color = 'gray', size = 0.5) +
    geom_point()
```

In a simple linear regression, there is only considered to be one source of random variability: any variability left unexplained by a set of predictors (which are modelled as fixed estimates) is captured in the model residuals.  
  
Multi-level (or 'mixed-effects') approaches involve modelling more than one source of random variability - as well as variance resulting from taking a random sample of observations, we can identify random variability across different groups of observations. For example, if we are studying a patient population in a hospital, we would expect there to be variability across the our sample of patients, but also across the doctors who treat them.  
  
We can account for this variability by allowing the outcome to be lower/higher for each group (a random intercept) and by allowing the estimated effect of a predictor vary across groups (random slopes).

`r optbegin("Clustered (multi-level) data", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
When our data is clustered (or 'grouped') such that datapoints are no longer independent, but belong to some grouping such as that of multiple observations from the same subject, we have multiple sources of random variability. A simple regression does not capture this.  

If we separate out our data to show an individual plot for each subject, we can see how the fitted regression line from `lm()` is assumed to be the same for each subject.  
  
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=10}

`r optend()`

`r optbegin("Random intercepts", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
By including a random-intercept term, we are letting our model estimate random variability around an average parameter (represented by the fixed effects) for the clusters.

:::frame 

**Formula:**  
Level 1:  
  
+ $y_{ij} = \beta_{0i} + \beta_{1i} x_{ij} + \epsilon_{ij}$  
  
Level 2:  
  
+ $\beta_{0i} = \gamma_{00} + \zeta_{0i}$   

Where the expected values of $\zeta_{0}$, and $\epsilon$ are 0, and their variances are $\sigma_{0}^2$ and $\sigma_\epsilon^2$ respectively. We will further assume that these are normally distributed.

We can now see that the intercept estimate $\beta_{0i}$ for a particular group $i$ is represented by the combination of a mean estimate for the parameter ($\gamma_{00}$) and a random effect for that group ($\zeta_{0i}$).

**R command:**  
  
+ `lmer(outcome ~ predictor + (1 | grouping), data = dataframe)`

Notice how the fitted line of the random intercept model has an adjustment for each subject.  
Each subject's line has been moved up or down accordingly.

`r optbegin("Shrinkage", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

If you think about it, we might have done a similar thing with the tools we already had at our disposal, by using `lm(y~x+subject)`.
This would give us a coefficient for the difference between each subject and the reference level intercept, or we could extend this to `lm(y~x*subject)` to give us an adjustment to the slope for each subject.  
  
However, the estimate of these models will be slightly different:  

```{r echo=FALSE}
plot_shrinkage
```

**Why?** One of the benefits of multi-level models is that our cluster-level estimates are shrunk towards the average depending on a) the level of across-cluster variation and b) the number of datapoints in clusters. 

`r optend()`

`r optbegin("Random slopes", olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

**Formula:**  
Level 1:

Level 2:  
  
+ $\beta_{0i} = \gamma_{00} + \zeta_{0i}$  
+ $\beta_{1i} = \gamma_{10} + \zeta_{1i}$  

Where the expected values of $\zeta_0$, $\zeta_1$, and $\epsilon$ are 0, and their variances are $\sigma_{0}^2$, $\sigma_{1}^2$, $\sigma_\epsilon^2$ respectively. We will further assume that these are normally distributed.

As with the intercept $\beta_{0i}$, the slope of the predictor $\beta_{1i}$ is now modelled by a mean $\gamma_{10}$ and a random effect for each group ($\zeta_{1i}$). 


**R command:** 
  
+ `lmer(outcome ~ predictor + (1 + predictor | grouping), data = dataframe)`  
  
*Note:* this is the same as `lmer(outcome ~ predictor + (predictor | grouping), data = dataframe)` . Like in the fixed-effects part, the `1 +` is assumed in the random-effects part.

`r optbegin("Polynomials!", olabel=FALSE, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

Sometimes, data have a clear non-linear pattern, such as a curvilinear trend. In such case, it is reasonable to try modelling the outcome _not_ as a linear function of the variable, but as a curvilinear function of it.

The following plots show data (as black dots) where the outcome $y$ has a nonlinear and decreasing dependence on $x$. That is, as $x$ varies from 1 to 10, the outcome $y$ decreases in a non-linear fashion.
Superimposed to the same data, you can see a linear fit (red line) and a cubic fit (blue).

```{r echo=FALSE, out.widt='100%', fig.heigth = 4, fig.width = 8}
set.seed(5)

u = seq(1, 10, by = 0.5)
v = -(0.2 * u)^3 + rnorm(length(u), sd = 0.2)

pm1 = lm(v ~ u)
pm2 = lm(v ~ 1 + u + I(u^2) + I(u^3))

par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(u, v, pch = 16, frame.plot = FALSE, xlab = 'x', ylab = 'y')
curve(cbind(1, x) %*% coef(pm1), col = 'red', add = TRUE)

plot(u, v, pch = 16, frame.plot = FALSE, xlab = 'x', ylab = 'y')
curve(cbind(1, x, x^2, x^3) %*% coef(pm2), col = 'dodgerblue', add = TRUE)
```

The residuals corresponding to each fit are:
```{r echo=FALSE, out.widt='100%', fig.heigth = 4, fig.width = 8}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))

plot(fitted(pm1), resid(pm1), col = 'red', pch = 16, frame.plot = FALSE)
abline(h = 0, col = 'darkgray', xlab = 'Fitted', y = 'Residuals')

plot(fitted(pm2), resid(pm2), col = 'dodgerblue', pch = 16, frame.plot = FALSE)
abline(h = 0, col = 'darkgray', xlab = 'Fitted', y = 'Residuals')
```

Clearly, a linear fit doesn't capture the real trend in the data, and any leftover systematic pattern that the model doesn't explicity account for always ends up in the residuals as the red points show.

On the other hand, once we account for the nonlinear trend, that systematic pattern in the residuals disappears.


The secret is to use instead of $x$ as a predictor, the corresponding polynomial up to a specific order:

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \beta_2 x^2 + \beta_3 x^3 + \epsilon
$$

Consider the following example data. You can add polynomials up to order 3, for example, of a predictor "time" by saying:

```{r echo=FALSE}
df <- tibble(subject = 1, reaction = rexp(5, 3), time = 1:5)
df
```

```{r}
source("https://uoepsy.github.io/msmr/functions/code_poly.R")

code_poly(df, predictor = 'time', poly.order = 3, draw.poly = FALSE)
```

and use those terms when specifying your linear model, for example:

```
lmer(reaction ~ poly1 + poly2 + poly3 + (1 | subject))
```


`r optend()`

`r optbegin("Fixed effects", olabel=FALSE, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
We can extract the *fixed effects* using the `fixef()` function:

These are the overall intercept and slope.

The plots below show the fitted values for each subject from each model that we have gone through in these expandable boxes (simple linear regression, random intercept, and random intercept & slope):

In the random-intercept model (center panel), the differences from each of the subjects' intercepts to the fixed intercept (thick green line) have mean 0 and standard deviation $\sigma_0$.  The standard deviation (and variance, which is $\sigma_0^2$) is what we see in the random effects part of our model summary (or using the `VarCorr()` function).  

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="400px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/varcors.PNG")
```

In the random-slope model (right panel), the same is true for the differences from each subjects' slope to the fixed slope. 
We can extract the deviations for each group from the fixed effect estimates using the `ranef()` function.  
  
These are the deviations from the overall intercept ($\widehat \gamma_{00} = `r b1[1]`$) and slope ($\widehat \gamma_{10} = `r b1[2]`$) for each subject $i$.  
```{r}
ranef(random_slopes_model)

We can also see the actual intercept and slope for each subject $i$ directly, using the `coef()` function.  

```{r}

The quick and easy way to plot your random effects is to use the `dotplot.ranef.mer()` function in `lme4`. 

```{r}
randoms <- ranef(random_slopes_model, condVar=TRUE)
dotplot.ranef.mer(randoms)
```

`r optbegin("Completely optional - extracting them for plotting in ggplot", olabel=FALSE, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
Sometimes, however, we might want to have a bit more control over our plotting, we can extract the estimates and correlations for each subject:  
```{r}
#we can get the random effects:
#(note that we use $subject because there might be other groupings, and the ranef() function will give us a list, with one element for each grouping variable)
randoms <-
  ranef(random_slopes_model)$subject %>%
  mutate(subject = row.names(.)) %>%  # the subject IDs are stored in the rownames, so lets add them as a variable
  pivot_longer(cols=1:2, names_to="term",values_to="estimate") # finally, let's reshape it for plotting

#and the same for the standard errors (from the arm package):
randoms_se <-
  arm::se.ranef(random_slopes_model)$subject %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  mutate(subject = row.names(.)) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols=1:2, names_to="term",values_to="se")

# join them together:
ranefs_plotting <- left_join(randoms, randoms_se)

# it's easier for plotting if we
ggplot(ranefs_plotting, aes(y=subject, x=estimate))+
  geom_errorbarh(aes(xmin=estimate-2*se, xmax=estimate+2*se))+
  facet_wrap(~term, scales="free_x")

```

`r optbegin("Nested and Crossed structures",olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

The same principle we have seen for one level of clustering can be extended to clustering at different levels (for instance, observations are clustered within subjects, which are in turn clustered within groups). 

Consider the example where we have observations for each student in every class within a number of schools:  

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="1200px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/structure_id.png")
```

**Question:** Is "Class 1" in "School 1" the same as "Class 1" in "School 2"?  
  
No.  
The classes in one school are distinct from the classes in another **even though they are named the same**.  
  
The classes-within-schools example is a good case of **nested random effects** - one factor level (one group in a grouping varible) appears *only within* a particular level of another grouping variable.  
  
In R, we can specify this using:  
  
`(1 | school) + (1 | class:school)`  
  
or, more succinctly:  
  
`(1 | school/class)`  

Consider another example, where we administer the same set of tasks at multiple time-points for every participant.  
  
**Question:** Are tasks nested within participants?  
  
No.  
Tasks are seen by multiple participants (and participants see multiple tasks).  
  
We could visualise this as the below:  
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="400px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/structure_crossed.png")
```

In the sense that these are not nested, they are **crossed** random effects.  
  
In R, we can specify this using:  

`(1 | subject) + (1 | task)`  

:::blue
**Nested vs Crossed**  

*Nested:* Each group belongs uniquely to a higher-level group.   

*Crossed:* Not-nested. 

:::

Note that in the schools and classes example, had we changed data such that the classes had unique IDs (e.g., see below), then the structures `(1 | school) + (1 | class)` and `(1 | school/class)` would give the same results.  
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="1200px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/structure_nested.png")
```

# Exercise A

`r qbegin("A1")`
Research question:

> Do children scores in maths improve more in school 2020 vs school 2040?

Load into R the data from the beginning of this lab, on mathematics performance in two schools. These can be found at the following link: https://uoepsy.github.io/data/MathsAchievement.csv

Make sure that variables encoding groups are stored as factors!

Recall that the data represent longitudinal measurements on 42 students from two different schools, with id 2020 and 2040 (21 students from each school). The outcome of interest is mathematics achievement. 
The data were collected at the end of first grade and annually thereafter up to sixth grade, but not all students have six observations. 
The variable year has been mean-centred to have mean 0 so that results will have as baseline the average.

         childid = factor(childid))

head(schools)
```

`r solend()`


`r qbegin("A2")`
Fit the appropriate model to answer the research question. 

Think carefully - what is the question concerning? Where should you include `schoolid`? as a grouping level, or as a fixed effect?

1. extract the overall intercept and slope. 
2. extract the deviations from the overall intercept and slope for each child.  
3. extract the actual intercept and slope for the line of child $i$  
4. how do you compute the intercept and slope for the line of child 273030991 using the output from (1) and (2)? Does it agree with (3)?

# Exercise B


## The data

`r optbegin("Data codebook",olabel=FALSE,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

44 participants across 4 groups (between-subjects) were tested 5 times (waves) in 11 domains. 
In each wave, participants received a score (on a 20-point scale) for each domain and a set of questions which were they answered either correctly or incorrectly.  

```{r}
load(url("https://uoepsy.github.io/data/msmr_lab5.RData"))

summary(dat5)
```

`r optend()`


## Exercise Ba. 

> Research question 
> Did the groups differ in overall performance?

  
There are different ways to test this: use the 20-point score or the accuracy? Keep the domains separate or calculate an aggregate across all domains? Which way makes the most sense to you?  
  
`r qbegin("B1")`
Make a plot that corresponds to the reseach question. Does it look like there's a difference?
`r qend()` 
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
Lots of options for this one, here is one that shows Group and Domain differences:

```{r}
ggplot(dat5, aes(Domain, Score, color=Group)) +
  stat_summary(fun.data=mean_se, geom="pointrange") +
  coord_flip()
```

Looks like there are group differences and domain differences, but not much in the way of group-by-domain differences.
`r solend()` 



`r qbegin("B2")`
Use a mixed-effects model to test the difference.  
  
+ Will you use a linear or logistic model?
+ What should the fixed(s) effect be? 
+ What should the random effect(s) be? We have observations clustered by subjects and by domains - are they nested?  
  
  
*Tip:* For now, forget about the longitudinal aspect to the data.
`r qend()` 
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
We're interested in the amount to which Groups vary in their overall performance, so we want a fixed effect of Group. Subjects and Domains are not nested - each subject sees different domains, and each domain is seen by multiple subjects.  

```{r}
# maximal model doesn't converge, removed random Group slopes for Domain
mod_grp <- lmer(Score ~ Group + 
                   (1 | Anonymous_Subject_ID) + 
                   (1 | Domain), 
                 data=dat5, REML=FALSE)
summary(mod_grp)
```

Yes, substantial Group differences: overall, group A does the best, groups B and C next, and group W does the worst. 
`r solend()` 




## Exercise Bb

> Research question 
> Did performance change over time (across waves)? Did the groups differ in pattern of change?

`r qbegin("B3")`
Make a plot that corresponds to the research question. Does it look like there was a change? A group difference?
`r qend()` 
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=4}
ggplot(dat5, aes(Wave, Score, color=Group, fill=Group)) +
  stat_summary(fun.data=mean_se, geom="ribbon", alpha=0.3, color=NA) +
  stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom="line")
```

Yes, looks like groups A, C, and W are improving, but group B is getting worse.
`r solend()` 



`r qbegin("B4")`
Use mixed-effects model(s) to test this.  
<br>
*Hint:* Fit a baseline model in which scores change over time (wave), then assess improvement in model fit due to inclusion of overall group effect and finally the interaction of group with time.  
`r qend()`

mod_wv <- lmer(Score ~ Wave +

`r qbegin("B5")`
Plot the group-level data (see Question B3) and model fitted values for each group from your final model from Question B4.  
<br>
*Hint:* using `broom.mixed::augment(model)` as your starting point will help.  
`r qend()` 
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

  stat_summary(aes(y=.fitted), fun=mean, geom="line")

*We fit a linear model, but the model fit lines are not straight lines. Why is that?*  
`r solend()` 



`r qbegin("B6")`
Create individual subject plots for the data and the model's fitted values. Will these show straight lines?  
<br>
*Hint:* make use of `facet_wrap()` to create a different panel for each level of a grouping variable.  
`r qend()`

  facet_wrap(~ Anonymous_Subject_ID) +
  stat_summary(fun.data=mean_se, geom="pointrange") +
  stat_summary(aes(y=.fitted), fun.y=mean, geom="line")

The individual subject plots show linear fits, which is a better match to the model. But now we see the missing data -- some participants only completed the first few waves.

`r qbegin("B8")`
What important things are different between the plot from question B7 and that from question B5?  
You can see the plots we created for these questions below:

  geom_line() +
  labs(title="Q B7")
```


`r qend()` 
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
*Group B was not actually getting worse. The appearance that it was getting worse is an artifact of selective drop-out: there's only a few people in this group and the better-performing ones only did the first few waves so they are not represented in the later waves, but the worse-performing ones are contributing to the later waves. The model estimates how the better-performing ones would have done in later waves based on their early-wave performance and the pattern of performance of other participants in the study.*  

```{r echo=FALSE}
cfs <- coef(summary(mod_wv_x_grp))
```

```{r}
summary(mod_wv_x_grp)$coefficients
```

Note that the Group A slope (coefficient for `Wave`) is `r round(cfs[2, 1], 3)` and, relative to that slope, the Group B slope is `r round(cfs[6, 1], 3)` (coefficient for `Wave:GroupB`). This means that the model-estimated slope for Group B is `r round(cfs[2, 1] + cfs[6, 1], 3)`, which is very slightly positive, not strongly negative as appeared in the initial plots.

One of the valuable things about mixed-effects (aka multilevel) modeling is that individual-level and group-level trajectories are estimated. This helps the model overcome missing data in a sensible way. In fact, MLM/MLR models are sometimes used for imputing missing data. However, one has to think carefully about *why* data are missing. Group B is small and it might just be a coincidence that the better-performing participants dropped out after the first few waves, which would make it easier to generalize the patterns to them. On the other hand, it might be the case that there is something about the study that makes better-performing members of Group B drop out, which should make us suspicious of generalizing to them.

`r qbegin("B9")`
Create a plot of the subject and domain random effects. 
Notice the pattern between the random intercept and random slope estimates for the 11 domains - what in our model is this pattern representing?  
`r qend()` 
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
```{r}
randoms <- ranef(mod_wv_x_grp, condVar=TRUE)
dotplot.ranef.mer(randoms)
```

Notice that the domains with the lower relative intercept tend to have a higher relative slope (and vice versa). This is the negative correlation between random intercepts and slopes for domain in our model: 
```{r}
VarCorr(mod_wv_x_grp)
```

Try removing the correlation (hint: use the `||`) to see what happens. Does it make sense that these would be correlated? (Answer: we don't really know enough about the study, but it's something to think about!)
