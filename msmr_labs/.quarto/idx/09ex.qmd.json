We specify our theoretical model of the world as a system of paths between variables that represent which variables influence which other variables. This is simply a diagramatic way of specifying a set of equations. \n    - A single headed arrow from $X \\rightarrow Y$ indicates that Y \"listens to\" X - if X changes, then Y will change accordingly (but not vice versa)\n    - A double headed arrow between $X \\leftrightarrow Y$ indicates that these two variables are related, not because one causes the other, but because there is some mechanism outside of our model that results in these two variables being associated.\n2. We collect data on the relevant variables and we observe a covariance matrix (i.e. how each variable covaries with every other variable). \n3. We fit our model to the data, and evaluate how well our theoretical model (the estimated values for our path coefficients) can reproduce the observed covariance matrix. \n\n\n:::sticky\n**Terminology**  \n\n- **Exogenous variables** are a bit like what we have been describing with words like \"independent variable\" or \"predictor\". In a path diagram, they have no arrows coming into them from other variables in the system, but have paths *going out* to other variables.  \n- **Endogenous variables** are more like the \"outcome\"/\"dependent\"/\"response\" variables we are used to. They have some arrow coming into them from another variable in the system (and may also - but not necessarily - have paths going out from them).  \n:::\n\n<br>\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n## optional: The fun details!  \n\nFor Path Diagrams that meet a certain set of pre-requisites, we can use a cool technique called \"Path Tracing\" to move between the path estimates and the implied covariances between a set of variables. The process is much easier with correlations, so in the examples below everything is standardised to have a variance of 1, meaning that covariance == correlation.  \n\nFor us to be able to do this, a Path Diagram must meet these criteria:\n\n- The model has no two-way causal relations or feedback loops (e.g. A$\\rightarrow$B$\\rightarrow$C$\\rightarrow$A).  \n- All relations are linear and additive.  \n- 'causes' are unitary (if A$\\rightarrow$B and A$\\rightarrow$C, then it is presumed that this is the same aspect of A resulting in a change in both B and C, and not two distinct aspects of A, which would be better represented by two correlated variables A1 and A2).  \n- The variables are measured without error (we will relax this assumption later on by including latent variables).\n- Endogenous variables are not connected by correlations (we would correlate the residuals instead, because residuals are not endogenous).  \n- The residuals (error terms) are uncorrelated with exogenous variables.  \n- All our exogenous variables are correlated (unless we specifically assume that their correlation is zero).  \n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n#### causality?\n\nPath models allow us to reason about 'cause and effect' without having to conduct an experiment and manipulate a given variable. However, there is nothing special about the statistical machinery or techniques here that makes our results 'causal'. The extent to which we can claim 'causation' is *entirely* theory dependent. That is, the use of 'causal' refers to an assumption that our analysis includes all relevant causal relations (and captures them appropriately). When we test these models, a good fitting model does **not** prove that the causal assumptions are correct.  \n\n:::\n\n\n__Path Tracing Rules__  \n\nThanks to [Sewal Wright](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2527551.pdf?casa_token=3QF0ad2ZoBcAAAAA:MbEkDNNdoLZr1SXE4LrnK--qrhhsTXLgsRtcWre1UvWxiQiGNUl5vWytGp34XIxhAYMZJe-MbIcBnEwXSfX6MAONevz04-sMXpEDI3IaYKk6mMX46QvX), we can express the correlation between any two variables in the system as the sum of all *compound paths* between the two variables^[if we were wanting covariances, and we didn't have standardised variables, then these would have to be multiplied by the corresponding variance estimates for the variables].  \n\n*compound paths* are the products of any paths you can trace between A and B for which there are: \n\n- no loops. If you are tracing from one variable to another, you cannot pass through the same variable twice in a particular path. \n- no going forward then backward (and no going forward then across a curved arrow)^[You can't go out of one arrow-head into another\narrow-head. We can go heads-to-tails, or tails-to-heads, not heads-heads]\n- maximum of one curved arrow per path\n\nIf we look at our path diagram and find all the distinct routes to get from A to B that adhere to the 3 rules above, and sum these routes up, then we get the implied covariance between A and B. \n(routes are 'distinct' if they contain different coefficients, or encounter coefficients in a different order).  \n\n\n::::panelset\n:::panel\n#### Example 1\n\nLet's consider the example below, for which the paths are all labelled with lower case letters $a, b, c, \\text{and } d$. In this case, we have two exogenous variables X1 and X2 that both influence a single outcome Y. This is actually just a multiple regression expressed as a path diagram!  \n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-patheq1\n#| fig.cap: \"A multiple regression model as a path diagram\"\n#| echo: false\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/patheq1.png\")\n```\n\nAccording to Wright's tracing rules above, we can write out the equations corresponding to the 3 correlations between our observed variables (remember that $r_{a,b} = r_{b,a}$, so it doesn't matter at which variable we start the paths). \n\nThere is only one way to move between X1 and X2, according to Wright's rules, and that is to go via the double headed arrow $c$. There are two ways to go from X1 to Y - we can go across the double headed arrow to X2, and then go from X2 to y (path $bc$), or we can go directly from X1 to Y (path $a$). To get from X2 to Y, we can go either via X1 (path $ac$), or go directly (path $b$).  \n\n| covariance    | paths  |\n| ------------- | ------ |\n| $r_{x1,x2}$ | c      |\n| $r_{x1,y}$  | a + bc |\n| $r_{x2,y}$  | b + ac |\n\nSuppose that we fit this model to some data using something like our good friend maximum likelihood estimation, and we get some estimates for our path coefficients such as those below:  \n\n```{r}\n#| code-fold: true\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(lavaan)\n# our data:\negdata <- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/path_eg1.csv\")\n# our model formula\nmod.formula <- \"y ~ x1 + x2\"\n# fitted to some data\nmod.est <- sem(mod.formula, data = egdata)\n# extract parameters:\nparTable(mod.est) |> select(lhs,op,rhs,est)\n```\n\nWith this set of path estimates ($a = 0.61$, $b = 0.38$, and $c = 0.36$), we can calculate the correlation that is *implied* by our estimated model:  \n\n| covariance   | paths  | model implied correlation           |\n| ------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------- |\n| $r_{x1,x2}$ | c      | $0.36$                             |\n| $r_{x1,y}$  | a + bc | $0.61 + (0.38 \\times 0.36) = 0.75$ |\n| $r_{x2,y}$  | b + ac | $0.38 + (0.61 \\times 0.36) = 0.60$ |\n\nWe can then examine how far off this is from the observed covariance matrix. In this specific case, our covariance matrix has 6 values in it, and we are estimating 6 things (see the parameters above). This means that there is unique solution, and our model is **just-identified** (or \"saturated\"), and is capable of **perfectly** reproducing the covariance matrix.  \n```{r}\ncov(egdata) |> round(2)\n```\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n#### why 6? the model in full  \n\nThe variances of individual variables (also covariances of each variable with itself) are also in our covariance matrix on the diagonals, and in full, our model also includes the estimation of variances of exogenous variables, as well as the residual variance of endogenous variables. These can be represented as the paths $d$, $e$ and $f$ in @fig-patheq1a.  \n\n| covariance    | paths  |\n| ------------- | ------ |\n| $r_{x1,x2}$ | c      |\n| $r_{x1,y}$  | a + bc |\n| $r_{x2,y}$  | b + ac |\n| $r_{x1,x1}$  | e |\n| $r_{x2,x2}$  | f |\n| $r_{y,y}$  | d + a$^2$ + b$^2$ + acb + bca  |\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-patheq1a\n#| fig.cap: \"A multiple regression model as a path diagram with variances of exogenous variables and residuals indicated\"\n#| echo: false\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/patheq1a.png\")\n```\n\n:::\n\n\n\n:::\n:::panel\n#### Example 2\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\n#| echo: false\nmm = \"\ny1 ~ .4*m + .3*x\ny2 ~ .2*m\nm ~ .6*x\n\"\ndf = simulateData(mm,sample.nobs = 500)\ndf = as.data.frame(apply(df,2,scale))\n# round(cor(df),2)\n# write_csv(df, \"../../data/path_eg2.csv\")\n```\n\n\n\nOne benefit of a path model over a regression model is that we can include multiple endogenous variables. In @fig-patheq2, we can see now a model in which we have two outcomes (Y1 and Y2), an exogenous predictor X, and a variable M that sits on the path between X and the two outcomes. In this case, M is itself an outcome of Z. \n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-patheq2\n#| fig.cap: \"A model with 2 outcomes\"\n#| echo: false\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/patheq2.png\")\n```\n\nUsing the path tracing rules, there is only one way to get between X and M, and that is the path $a$. There is only one way to get between M and Y1 (path $b$), and only one way to get between M and Y2 (path $c$). To get between X and Y1, we can only go via $ab$, and to get between X and Y2, we can only go via $ac$. To get between Y1 and Y2, we can go backwards to M and then forwards to Y2, the path $bc$.   \n\n| covariance   | paths |\n| ------------ | ----- |\n| $r_{x,m}$  | a     |\n| $r_{m,y1}$ | b     |\n| $r_{m,y2}$ | c     |\n| $r_{x,y1}$ | ab    |\n| $r_{x,y2}$ | ac    |\n| $r_{y1,y2}$ | bc    |\n\nAs with the previous example, we fit our model to some sample data, and get some estimates for the parameters:  \n\n```{r}\n#| code-fold: true\n# our data:\negdata2 <- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/path_eg2.csv\")\n# our model formula\nmod.formula <- \"\ny1 ~ m\ny2 ~ m\nm ~ x\n# by default, lavaan will correlate the residual variance\n# for the purposes of this example, to match our model exactly, \n# we'll constrain it to 0:  \ny1~~0*y2\n\"\n# fitted to some data\nmod.est <- sem(mod.formula, data = egdata2)\n# extract parameters:\nparTable(mod.est) |> select(lhs,op,rhs,est)\n```\n\nAnd the estimated path coefficients of $a = 0.46$, $b = 0.52$ and $c = 0.19$, imply that our covariances are:  \n\n| covariance   | paths | model implied covariance  |\n| ------------ | ----- | ------------------------- |\n| $r_{x,m}$  | a     | $0.46$                    |\n| $r_{m,y1}$ | b     | $0.52$                    |\n| $r_{m,y2}$ | c     | $0.19$                    |\n| $r_{x,y1}$ | ab    | $0.46 \\times 0.52 = 0.24$ |\n| $r_{x,y2}$ | ac    | $0.46 \\times 0.19 = 0.09$ |\n| $r_{y1,y2}$ | bc    | $0.52 \\times 0.19 = 0.10$ |\n\nFinally, our **observed** covariances are here:  \n```{r}\ncov(egdata2) |> round(2)\n```\n\nBut wait.. unlike the first example, this one does _not_ perfectly reproduce our the covariances we observe. This is because our model is **over-identified**. We are trying to recreate our covariance matrix with 10 values in it using only **7** unknown parameters. This is a good thing! It means we can assess the fit of the model to the data, and evaluate the plausibility of the proposed relationships!  \n\nNotably, some of our \"model implied covariances\" are quite different to those in our observed covariance matrix (e.g, the model implies that $r_{x,y1} = 0.24$, but we actually observe it to be 0.49!).  \n\n:::\n:::panel\n#### Example 3\n\nIn Example 2, our theoretical model proposed that *all* of the association that we might observe between X and Y1 is due to the relationship that X has with M, and that M in turn has with Y1.  However, an alternative model (see @fig-patheq3) could propose that X still directly influences Y1 beyond the influence it exerts via M. We would indicate this via an additional path (path $g$ in @fig-patheq3).  \n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-patheq3\n#| fig.cap: \"X now directly influences Y, as well as its influence via M\"\n#| echo: false\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/patheq3.png\")\n```\n\nFitting this model (to the same data), we get out estimates for the paths (including this additional parameter): \n\n```{r}\n#| code-fold: true\n# our model formula\nmod.formula <- \"\ny1 ~ m + x\ny2 ~ m\nm ~ x\n# by default, lavaan will correlate the residual variance\n# for the purposes of this example, to match our model exactly, \n# we'll constrain it to 0:  \ny1~~0*y2\n\"\n# fitted to the same data as for example 2\nmod.est <- sem(mod.formula, data = egdata2)\n# extract parameters:\nparTable(mod.est) |> select(lhs,op,rhs,est)\n```\n\nOur covariances between variables are, in this model, expressed as: \n\n| covariance   | paths | model implied covariance |\n| ------------ | ----- | ------ |\n| $r_{x,m}$  | a     |  $0.46$  |\n| $r_{m,y1}$ | b + ag | $0.38 + (0.46 \\times 0.31) = 0.52$ |\n| $r_{m,y2}$ | c   |   $0.19$   |\n| $r_{x,y1}$ | ab + g | $(0.46 \\times 0.38) + 0.31 = 0.49$ |\n| $r_{x,y2}$ | ac    |  $0.46 \\times 0.19 = 0.09$  |\n| $r_{y1,y2}$ | bc + gac | $(0.38 \\times 0.19) + (0.31 \\times 0.46 \\times 0.19) = 0.10$  |\n\nAnd now, when we look at our observed covariance matrix, we are doing a much better job of recreating it, than we did with the model from Example 2!  \n```{r}\ncov(egdata2) |> round(2)\n```\n\n:::\n::::\n\n:::\n\n# Education and Salary\n\n\n:::frame\n\n```{r}\n#| include: false\nlibrary(lavaan)\nset.seed(777)\ndf = tibble::tibble(\n  Educ = round(rnorm(390, 15.5, 3)),\n  Skill = round(scale(.6*scale(Educ) + rnorm(390))[,1],2),\n  Salary = scale(.12*scale(Educ) + .3*Skill + rnorm(390,0,1))[,1]*12.3 + 39.533\n)\n# readr::write_csv(df,file=\"../../data/edskill.csv\")\n# m=\"\n# Salary ~ c*Educ + b*Skill\n# Skill ~ a*Educ\n# ind:=a*b\n# total:=a*b+c\n# \"\n# sem(m, df) |> summary()\n#lm(Salary ~ Educ + Skill,df) |> summary()\n  \n\n```\n\nWe sampled 500 people who were all 5 years out of their last year of education. All participants completed an extensive questionnaire to ascertain the number of and expertise in any skills that may be of potential interest to employers. This resulted in a \"Skillset Metric\". 5 years later, participants were followed up and asked to provide their current salaries. 110 participants failed to respond to follow-ups and thus the final sample included 390 people.  \n\nThe data are available at [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/edskill.csv](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/edskill.csv){target=\"_blank\"}.  \n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\ntibble(\n  variable = names(df),\n  description = c(\n    \"Number of years of education undertaken\",\n    \"Skillset metric (standardised score obtained via a 100 item questionnaire measuring the number of, and expertise in, any skills deemed relevant to employers)\",\n    \"Salary (in thousands of £)\"\n  )\n) |> gt::gt()\n```\n\n:::\n\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`\nRead in the dataset.  \nLet's suppose that the only statistical machinery available to us is the good old regression models with `lm()`, and we are interested in the estimated effect of education on salary.    \n\nWhich model are you going to fit?  \n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nlm(Salary ~ Educ, data = ... )\nlm(Salary ~ Skill + Educ, data = ... )\n```\n\n\n`r qend()`\n`r solbegin(show=TRUE, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nHere's the data: \n```{r}\nedskill <- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/edskill.csv\")\n```\n\nI'm going to fit both models so that we can discuss them below\n```{r}\nm1 <- lm(Salary ~ Educ, data = edskill)\nm2 <- lm(Salary ~ Skill + Educ, data = edskill)\n# model tables side by side\nsjPlot::tab_model(m1,m2)\n```\n\nSo we have got two quite different pictures. The first model says that for every additional year of education, the salary offered would be £1070 more. The second model says it would only be £480 more, and it looks like skills are a lot more important than education is for getting a good salary, right?  \n\nBut this makes it sound like Education and Skills are things that we can compare the effects of independently. The implicit model we are referring to when using `lm(Salary ~ Skill + Educ)` is in the left hand diagram, Model A, of @fig-educ. But does it not make a lot more sense to think that Education is a cause of peoples' skill level (especially as the skill level being measured 5 years after their last year of education precludes the opposite direction). In other words, does Model B in @fig-educ not make more sense?  \n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: \"100%\"\n#| label: fig-educ\n#| fig-cap: \"Two theoretical models of process that gives rise to the data\"\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/path_educ.png\")\n```\n\n::::{.columns}\n:::{.column width=\"80%\"}\nWhat Model B suggests is that part of *how* education influences peoples' salaries is by giving them more skills. A perfect example is that you are all now on your way to becoming proficient R users! \n:::\n:::{.column width=\"5%\"}\n:::\n:::{.column width=\"15%\"}\n![](images/new-skill-unlocked.gif)\n:::\n::::\n\nThis is a great example that illustrates instances we might **not** want to include a variable in our model. If you are interested in \"what does having an extra year of education do for peoples' salaries?\", then controlling for skill in our model actually _removes_ that part of the mechanism by which education influences salary.  \n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n#### another example\n\nTo make this point super clear, suppose we were testing some drug that reduces blood pressure in order to lower the risk of cardiac arrest. \nWe do an experiment where we gave some people the drug, and some people a placebo, then after a year we measured their blood pressure, and then we followed up 5 years later to see how many experienced cardiac arrests.  \n\nThe diagram to show how these variable relate is clearly the one in @fig-pathdrugmed  \n```{r}\n#| label: fig-pathdrugmed\n#| fig-cap: \"A drug aimed at reducing cardiac arrests by lowering blood pressure. The faint grey line indicates the path that would be estimated if we attempted to control for post-treatment blood-pressure\"\n#| echo: false\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/path_drug.png\")\n```\n\nIf we fitted the model `lm(cardiac_arrest ~ blood_pressure + drug)`, then the estimated coefficient we get for `drug` will be the effect of the drug on cardiac arrests that *isn't* due to how it changes blood pressure. But that is exactly the opposite of what we want, because we think the drug works specifically by lowering blood pressure!  \n\nContrast this with another example, where we do not run an experiment and allocate people into \"drug\" or \"placebo\", we simply observe a whole load of people who either do or do not take the drug, and we follow them up to see how many have cardiac arrests. **But**, it is generally older people who take the drug, whereas younger people do not. In addition, older people have a higher risk of cardiac arrests. So our model is that seen in @fig-pathdrugcon.  \n```{r}\n#| label: fig-pathdrugcon\n#| fig-cap: \"We are interested in a drug aimed at reducing cardiac arrests. Older people are more likely to take the drug, and are also more likely to experience cardiac arrest\"\n#| echo: false\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/path_drug_con.png\")\n```\n\nIn this case, controlling for the third variable `age` is the right thing to do.  \nIf we do not control for age, and fit the model `lm(cardiac_arrest ~ drug)`, then the coefficient for `drug` will be biased because the group who take the drug are on average older, and thus will tend to experience more cardiac arrests. If the imbalance of age between the drug and no-drug groups is great enough, it could even look like the drug is making cardiac arrests _more_ likely!  \n\n:::\n\n`r solend()`\n\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`\nInstead, let's suppose we are actually interested in the mechanism of _how_ education influences salary. Do more educated people tend to have higher salaries in part because of the skills obtained during their education?  \n\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Direct, Indirect and Total effects\n\nIn path diagrams:\n\n- Direct effect = one single-headed arrow between the two variables concerned  \n- Indirect effect = An effect transmitted via some other variables   \n\nIf we have a variable $X$ that we take to 'cause' variable $Y$, then our path diagram will look like @fig-total, which path $c$ is the __total effect__. This is the _unmediated_ effect of $X$ on $Y$.  \n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| label: fig-total\n#| fig-cap: \"The total effect of X on Y\"\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/MED1.png\")\n```\n\nHowever, the effect of $X$ on $Y$ could in part be explained by the process of being mediated by some variable $M$ as well as affecting $Y$ directly. A path diagram representing this theoretical idea of 'mediation' is shown in @fig-indirect. In this case, path $c'$ is the __direct effect__, and paths $a$ and $b$ make up the __indirect effect__.  \n\n```{r echo=FALSE}\n#| echo: false\n#| label: fig-indirect\n#| fig-cap: \"The effect of X on Y is partly mediated by M\"\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/MED2.png\")\n```\n\n\nYou will find in some areas people talk about the ideas of __\"complete\"__ vs __\"partial\"__ mediation.\n\n- __Complete mediation__ is when $X$ does not influence $Y$ other than its influence through $M$ (therefore path $c'$ would not be significantly different from zero). \n- __Partial mediation__ is when the path from $X$ to $Y$ is _reduced in magnitude_ when the mediator $M$ is introduced, _but still different from zero._  \n- The __Proportion Mediated__ is the amount of the total effect of $X$ to $Y$ that goes via $M$. i.e. $\\frac{a \\times b}{c}$ in the images above. \n\n:::\n\n\nFit a path model in which education has an effect on salary both directly and indirectly, via its influence on the skills  obtained.  \n\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Hints\n\nA path model is essential a _set_ of equations. We can do this similarly these models similarly to how we estimated factor models using the __lavaan__ package, but instead of `cfa()` we use the function `sem()` to fit the models.\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nmod.formula <- \"\ny1 ~ x1 + x2 + x3\ny2 ~ x1\nx1 ~ x3\n\"\nmod.est <- sem(mod.formula, data = mydata)\n```\n\n:::\n\n\n`r qend()`\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\n```{r}\nmod1 <- \"\nSalary ~ Educ + Skill\nSkill ~ Educ\n\"\n\nmod1.est <- sem(mod1, data = edskill)\nsummary(mod1.est)\n```\n\n`r solend()`\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`\nWhile the model in the previous question better reflects our theoretical notions of how these variables are actually related, we would ideally get out an estimate of the indirect effect.  \n\n::::{.columns}\n:::{.column width=\"60%\"}\nThat is, we want to test the estimated path from X to Y through M. Typically, this is done by calculating the *product* of the sub-component paths.

The function, however, must be specified in terms of the parameter labels that are explicitly mentioned in the model syntax.\"_ ^[[the lavaan project](https://lavaan.ugent.be/){target=\"_blank\"}].  \nThe labels are entirely up to us, we can use \"a\", \"b\" and \"c\", or \"dougal\", \"dylan\" and \"ermintrude\", they're just labels!  \n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nmed_model <- \" \n    Y ~ b*M + c*X\n    M ~ a*X\n    \n    indirect := a*b\n    total := a*b + c\n\"\n```\n\n:::\n\nEdit your model formula from the previous question to also estimate both the total and the indirect effects.\n\n`r qend()`\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\n```{r}\nmod1 <- \"\nSalary ~ c*Educ + b*Skill\nSkill ~ a*Educ\n\nindirect := a*b\ntotal := a*b + c\n\"\n```\n\n\n`r solend()`\n\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`\nRe-fit the model, estimating the parameters using bootstrapping.  \nIs the association between education and salary mediated by skills?

However, this results in the estimated indirect effect rarely following a normal distribution, and makes our usual analytically derived standard errors & p-values inappropriate.   \n\nInstead, bootstrapping has become the norm for assessing sampling distributions of indirect effects in mediation models (remember, bootstrapping involves resampling the data with replacement, thousands of times, in order to empirically generate a sampling distribution).  \n\nWe can do this easily in lavaan:\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nmod.est <- sem(model_formula, data=my_data, se = \"bootstrap\") \n# to print out the confidence intervals:\nsummary(mod.est, ci = TRUE)\n```\n\n:::\n\n`r qend()`\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n# save(mod.est,mod1.est,model1.est,model2.est,file=\"data/pathmods.rdata\")\nload(\"data/pathmods.rdata\")\n```\n\nNote that we get a warning here, but it's not too much to worry about. It tells us that 8 (out of 1000) of the bootstraps has failed to converge. This means our bootstrapped estimates are really based on 992 bootstrap draws (and so a write up would need to clearly report this).  \nIf this number was bigger (e.g. 10% or 20% of the bootstraps failed) then we it would be more of a cause for concern.  \n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nmod1.est <- sem(mod1, data = edskill, se = \"bootstrap\")\n```\n<p style=\"color:red;font-size:0.8em\">Warning message:<br>\nIn lav_model_nvcov_bootstrap(lavmodel = lavmodel, lavsamplestats = lavsamplestats,  :<br>\n  lavaan WARNING: 8 bootstrap runs failed or did not converge.</p>\n\n```{r}\nsummary(mod1.est, ci = TRUE)\n```\n\n```{r}\n#| include: false\nres = partable(mod1.est)$est[\n  partable(mod1.est)$lhs %in% c(\"indirect\",\"total\")] |>\n  round(2)\n\nres2 = summary(mod1.est, ci=TRUE)$pe\nres2 = round(res2[res2$lhs==\"indirect\",c(\"est\",\"ci.lower\",\"ci.upper\")],2)\n```\n\nThe relationship between education and salary **is** mediated by skill level!

X$\\rightarrow$M$\\rightarrow$Y will fit your data just as well as X$\\rightarrow$Y$\\rightarrow$M or Y$\\rightarrow$M$\\rightarrow$X! \n- **Perfect reliability of M:** The mediator is measured without error\n- **No X-M interaction:** The effect of the mediator M on the outcome Y does not depend on the level of the predictor X. \n- **No confounding:** A variable that is a common cause of both X and Y will bias the total and direct effects, and a variable that is a common cause of both X and M will bias the indirect effect (it will bias the X$\\rightarrow$M path). Randomised experiments (i.e. randomly allocating people to different values of X) will avoid the first two, because nothing but the random allocation would cause X. However, confounding of the indirect effect can also happen if some variable is a common cause of both M and Y, and it is hard to randomly allocate to a mediator^[there _are_ methods that attempt to \"block\" a mediator, or to manipulate X in multiple ways in order to increase or decrease the mediators' effect.

Assess the total effect of the predictor on the outcome `y ~ x`. This step establishes that there *is* an effect that may be mediated.    \n```{r}\nmod1 <- lm(Salary ~ Educ, data = edskill)\nsummary(mod1)$coefficients\n```\n\nStep 2. Estimate the effect of the predictor on the mediator `m ~ x`:\n```{r}\nmod2 <- lm(Skill ~ Educ, data = edskill)\nsummary(mod2)$coefficients\n```\n\nStep 3. Estimate the effects of the predictor and mediator on the outcome `y ~ x + m`. We need to show that the mediator affects the outcome variable. \n```{r}\nmod3 <- lm(Salary ~ Educ + Skill, data = edskill)\nsummary(mod3)$coefficients\n```\n\nStep 4. If Steps 1-3 all show effects of `y~x`, `m~x` and `y~m|x`^[read `y~m|x` as `y~m` controlling for `x`] respectively, then we can assess mediation. We need to look at the how effect of the predictor on the outcome changes when we control for the mediator. This is from the same third model above. If the effect of the predictor is reduced, then we have mediation. If it is now zero, then we have complete mediation.  \n\nThis method is generally less optimal than using path models. Following the \"separate models\" approach^[sometimes referred to as \"steps approach\"] and requiring certain effects to be significant can sometimes lead to erroneous conclusions. For example, if `Y ~ 2*M + -2*X` and `M ~ 1*X`, then the total effect of `Y~X` would be $(2 \\times 1) + -2 = 0$, leading us to say that there is no effect that could be mediated! In part the problems with this approach are because it doesn't actually *estimate* the indirect effects, and attempts to determine \"is there mediation [Yes]/[No]?\" based on the significance of the individual paths. Even if the total effect $c$ is significantly different from zero and the direct effect $c'$ is not, this does not imply that the coefficients $c$ and $c'$ are different from one another! We therefore need to conduct an extra step (a popular approach is the \"Sobel's test\") in order to asses whether $c-c'=0$, or to estimate the $ab$ path via bootstrapping like we do in __lavaan__.  \n\nPerhaps a more relevant issue is that the separate models approach cannot so easily be generalised to situations with multiple mediators, multiple outcomes, or multiple predictors, whereas a path analytic approach can. In addition, both are susceptible to the same concerns of measurement reliability, confounding, predictor-mediator interactions, and the causal directions between variables.   \n\n<!-- ::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"} -->\n<!-- #### Optional - packages for estimating mediation effects -->\n\n<!-- The __mediation__ package is a very nice approach that allows us to conduct mediation this way, and it also extends to allow us to have categorical variables (we can use a logistic regression as one of our models), or to have multilevel data (our models can be fitted using __lme4__).   -->\n\n<!-- ```{r} -->\n<!-- library(mediation) -->\n<!-- mymediation <- mediate(model.m = mod2,  -->\n<!--                        model.y = mod3,  -->\n<!--                        treat='religiosity',  -->\n<!--                        mediator='hlc', -->\n<!--                        boot=TRUE, sims=500) -->\n\n<!-- summary(mymediation) -->\n<!-- ``` -->\n\n<!-- - ACME: Average Causal Mediation Effects (the indirect path $\\mathbf{a \\times b}$ in @fig-medpaths).   -->\n<!-- - ADE: Average Direct Effects (the direct path $\\mathbf{c'}$ in @fig-medpaths).   -->\n<!-- - Total Effect: sum of the mediation (indirect) effect and the direct effect (this is $\\mathbf{(a \\times b) + c)}$ in @fig-medpaths).   -->\n\n<!-- ```{r} -->\n<!-- #| echo: false -->\n<!-- #| label: fig-medpaths -->\n<!-- #| fig-cap: \"Mediation Model.

We specify our theoretical model of the world as a system of paths between variables that represent which variables influence which other variables. This is simply a diagramatic way of specifying a set of equations. \n    - A single headed arrow from $X \\rightarrow Y$ indicates that Y \"listens to\" X - if X changes, then Y will change accordingly (but not vice versa)\n    - A double headed arrow between $X \\leftrightarrow Y$ indicates that these two variables are related, not because one causes the other, but because there is some mechanism outside of our model that results in these two variables being associated.\n2. We collect data on the relevant variables and we observe a covariance matrix (i.e. how each variable covaries with every other variable). \n3. We fit our model to the data, and evaluate how well our theoretical model (the estimated values for our path coefficients) can reproduce the observed covariance matrix. \n\n\n:::sticky\n**Terminology**  \n\n- **Exogenous variables** are a bit like what we have been describing with words like \"independent variable\" or \"predictor\". In a path diagram, they have no arrows coming into them from other variables in the system, but have paths *going out* to other variables.  \n- **Endogenous variables** are more like the \"outcome\"/\"dependent\"/\"response\" variables we are used to. They have some arrow coming into them from another variable in the system (and may also - but not necessarily - have paths going out from them).  \n:::\n\n<br>\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n## optional: The fun details!  \n\nFor Path Diagrams that meet a certain set of pre-requisites, we can use a cool technique called \"Path Tracing\" to move between the path estimates and the implied covariances between a set of variables. The process is much easier with correlations, so in the examples below everything is standardised to have a variance of 1, meaning that covariance == correlation.  \n\nFor us to be able to do this, a Path Diagram must meet these criteria:\n\n- The model has no two-way causal relations or feedback loops (e.g. A$\\rightarrow$B$\\rightarrow$C$\\rightarrow$A).  \n- All relations are linear and additive.  \n- 'causes' are unitary (if A$\\rightarrow$B and A$\\rightarrow$C, then it is presumed that this is the same aspect of A resulting in a change in both B and C, and not two distinct aspects of A, which would be better represented by two correlated variables A1 and A2).  \n- The variables are measured without error (we will relax this assumption later on by including latent variables).\n- Endogenous variables are not connected by correlations (we would correlate the residuals instead, because residuals are not endogenous).  \n- The residuals (error terms) are uncorrelated with exogenous variables.  \n- All our exogenous variables are correlated (unless we specifically assume that their correlation is zero).  \n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n#### causality?\n\nPath models allow us to reason about 'cause and effect' without having to conduct an experiment and manipulate a given variable. However, there is nothing special about the statistical machinery or techniques here that makes our results 'causal'. The extent to which we can claim 'causation' is *entirely* theory dependent. That is, the use of 'causal' refers to an assumption that our analysis includes all relevant causal relations (and captures them appropriately). When we test these models, a good fitting model does **not** prove that the causal assumptions are correct.  \n\n:::\n\n\n__Path Tracing Rules__  \n\nThanks to [Sewal Wright](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2527551.pdf?casa_token=3QF0ad2ZoBcAAAAA:MbEkDNNdoLZr1SXE4LrnK--qrhhsTXLgsRtcWre1UvWxiQiGNUl5vWytGp34XIxhAYMZJe-MbIcBnEwXSfX6MAONevz04-sMXpEDI3IaYKk6mMX46QvX), we can express the correlation between any two variables in the system as the sum of all *compound paths* between the two variables^[if we were wanting covariances, and we didn't have standardised variables, then these would have to be multiplied by the corresponding variance estimates for the variables].  \n\n*compound paths* are the products of any paths you can trace between A and B for which there are: \n\n- no loops. If you are tracing from one variable to another, you cannot pass through the same variable twice in a particular path. \n- no going forward then backward (and no going forward then across a curved arrow)^[You can't go out of one arrow-head into another\narrow-head. We can go heads-to-tails, or tails-to-heads, not heads-heads]\n- maximum of one curved arrow per path\n\nIf we look at our path diagram and find all the distinct routes to get from A to B that adhere to the 3 rules above, and sum these routes up, then we get the implied covariance between A and B. \n(routes are 'distinct' if they contain different coefficients, or encounter coefficients in a different order).  \n\n\n::::panelset\n:::panel\n#### Example 1\n\nLet's consider the example below, for which the paths are all labelled with lower case letters $a, b, c, \\text{and } d$. In this case, we have two exogenous variables X1 and X2 that both influence a single outcome Y. This is actually just a multiple regression expressed as a path diagram!  \n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-patheq1\n#| fig.cap: \"A multiple regression model as a path diagram\"\n#| echo: false\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/patheq1.png\")\n```\n\nAccording to Wright's tracing rules above, we can write out the equations corresponding to the 3 correlations between our observed variables (remember that $r_{a,b} = r_{b,a}$, so it doesn't matter at which variable we start the paths). \n\nThere is only one way to move between X1 and X2, according to Wright's rules, and that is to go via the double headed arrow $c$. There are two ways to go from X1 to Y - we can go across the double headed arrow to X2, and then go from X2 to y (path $bc$), or we can go directly from X1 to Y (path $a$). To get from X2 to Y, we can go either via X1 (path $ac$), or go directly (path $b$).  \n\n| covariance    | paths  |\n| ------------- | ------ |\n| $r_{x1,x2}$ | c      |\n| $r_{x1,y}$  | a + bc |\n| $r_{x2,y}$  | b + ac |\n\nSuppose that we fit this model to some data using something like our good friend maximum likelihood estimation, and we get some estimates for our path coefficients such as those below:  \n\n```{r}\n#| code-fold: true\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(lavaan)\n# our data:\negdata <- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/path_eg1.csv\")\n# our model formula\nmod.formula <- \"y ~ x1 + x2\"\n# fitted to some data\nmod.est <- sem(mod.formula, data = egdata)\n# extract parameters:\nparTable(mod.est) |> select(lhs,op,rhs,est)\n```\n\nWith this set of path estimates ($a = 0.61$, $b = 0.38$, and $c = 0.36$), we can calculate the correlation that is *implied* by our estimated model:  \n\n| covariance   | paths  | model implied correlation           |\n| ------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------- |\n| $r_{x1,x2}$ | c      | $0.36$                             |\n| $r_{x1,y}$  | a + bc | $0.61 + (0.38 \\times 0.36) = 0.75$ |\n| $r_{x2,y}$  | b + ac | $0.38 + (0.61 \\times 0.36) = 0.60$ |\n\nWe can then examine how far off this is from the observed covariance matrix. In this specific case, our covariance matrix has 6 values in it, and we are estimating 6 things (see the parameters above). This means that there is unique solution, and our model is **just-identified** (or \"saturated\"), and is capable of **perfectly** reproducing the covariance matrix.  \n```{r}\ncov(egdata) |> round(2)\n```\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n#### why 6? the model in full  \n\nThe variances of individual variables (also covariances of each variable with itself) are also in our covariance matrix on the diagonals, and in full, our model also includes the estimation of variances of exogenous variables, as well as the residual variance of endogenous variables. These can be represented as the paths $d$, $e$ and $f$ in @fig-patheq1a.  \n\n| covariance    | paths  |\n| ------------- | ------ |\n| $r_{x1,x2}$ | c      |\n| $r_{x1,y}$  | a + bc |\n| $r_{x2,y}$  | b + ac |\n| $r_{x1,x1}$  | e |\n| $r_{x2,x2}$  | f |\n| $r_{y,y}$  | d + a$^2$ + b$^2$ + acb + bca  |\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-patheq1a\n#| fig.cap: \"A multiple regression model as a path diagram with variances of exogenous variables and residuals indicated\"\n#| echo: false\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/patheq1a.png\")\n```\n\n:::\n\n\n\n:::\n:::panel\n#### Example 2\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\n#| echo: false\nmm = \"\ny1 ~ .4*m + .3*x\ny2 ~ .2*m\nm ~ .6*x\n\"\ndf = simulateData(mm,sample.nobs = 500)\ndf = as.data.frame(apply(df,2,scale))\n# round(cor(df),2)\n# write_csv(df, \"../../data/path_eg2.csv\")\n```\n\n\n\nOne benefit of a path model over a regression model is that we can include multiple endogenous variables. In @fig-patheq2, we can see now a model in which we have two outcomes (Y1 and Y2), an exogenous predictor X, and a variable M that sits on the path between X and the two outcomes. In this case, M is itself an outcome of Z. \n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-patheq2\n#| fig.cap: \"A model with 2 outcomes\"\n#| echo: false\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/patheq2.png\")\n```\n\nUsing the path tracing rules, there is only one way to get between X and M, and that is the path $a$. There is only one way to get between M and Y1 (path $b$), and only one way to get between M and Y2 (path $c$). To get between X and Y1, we can only go via $ab$, and to get between X and Y2, we can only go via $ac$. To get between Y1 and Y2, we can go backwards to M and then forwards to Y2, the path $bc$.   \n\n| covariance   | paths |\n| ------------ | ----- |\n| $r_{x,m}$  | a     |\n| $r_{m,y1}$ | b     |\n| $r_{m,y2}$ | c     |\n| $r_{x,y1}$ | ab    |\n| $r_{x,y2}$ | ac    |\n| $r_{y1,y2}$ | bc    |\n\nAs with the previous example, we fit our model to some sample data, and get some estimates for the parameters:  \n\n```{r}\n#| code-fold: true\n# our data:\negdata2 <- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/path_eg2.csv\")\n# our model formula\nmod.formula <- \"\ny1 ~ m\ny2 ~ m\nm ~ x\n# by default, lavaan will correlate the residual variance\n# for the purposes of this example, to match our model exactly, \n# we'll constrain it to 0:  \ny1~~0*y2\n\"\n# fitted to some data\nmod.est <- sem(mod.formula, data = egdata2)\n# extract parameters:\nparTable(mod.est) |> select(lhs,op,rhs,est)\n```\n\nAnd the estimated path coefficients of $a = 0.46$, $b = 0.52$ and $c = 0.19$, imply that our covariances are:  \n\n| covariance   | paths | model implied covariance  |\n| ------------ | ----- | ------------------------- |\n| $r_{x,m}$  | a     | $0.46$                    |\n| $r_{m,y1}$ | b     | $0.52$                    |\n| $r_{m,y2}$ | c     | $0.19$                    |\n| $r_{x,y1}$ | ab    | $0.46 \\times 0.52 = 0.24$ |\n| $r_{x,y2}$ | ac    | $0.46 \\times 0.19 = 0.09$ |\n| $r_{y1,y2}$ | bc    | $0.52 \\times 0.19 = 0.10$ |\n\nFinally, our **observed** covariances are here:  \n```{r}\ncov(egdata2) |> round(2)\n```\n\nBut wait.. unlike the first example, this one does _not_ perfectly reproduce our the covariances we observe. This is because our model is **over-identified**. We are trying to recreate our covariance matrix with 10 values in it using only **7** unknown parameters. This is a good thing! It means we can assess the fit of the model to the data, and evaluate the plausibility of the proposed relationships!  \n\nNotably, some of our \"model implied covariances\" are quite different to those in our observed covariance matrix (e.g, the model implies that $r_{x,y1} = 0.24$, but we actually observe it to be 0.49!).  \n\n:::\n:::panel\n#### Example 3\n\nIn Example 2, our theoretical model proposed that *all* of the association that we might observe between X and Y1 is due to the relationship that X has with M, and that M in turn has with Y1.  However, an alternative model (see @fig-patheq3) could propose that X still directly influences Y1 beyond the influence it exerts via M. We would indicate this via an additional path (path $g$ in @fig-patheq3).  \n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-patheq3\n#| fig.cap: \"X now directly influences Y, as well as its influence via M\"\n#| echo: false\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/patheq3.png\")\n```\n\nFitting this model (to the same data), we get out estimates for the paths (including this additional parameter): \n\n```{r}\n#| code-fold: true\n# our model formula\nmod.formula <- \"\ny1 ~ m + x\ny2 ~ m\nm ~ x\n# by default, lavaan will correlate the residual variance\n# for the purposes of this example, to match our model exactly, \n# we'll constrain it to 0:  \ny1~~0*y2\n\"\n# fitted to the same data as for example 2\nmod.est <- sem(mod.formula, data = egdata2)\n# extract parameters:\nparTable(mod.est) |> select(lhs,op,rhs,est)\n```\n\nOur covariances between variables are, in this model, expressed as: \n\n| covariance   | paths | model implied covariance |\n| ------------ | ----- | ------ |\n| $r_{x,m}$  | a     |  $0.46$  |\n| $r_{m,y1}$ | b + ag | $0.38 + (0.46 \\times 0.31) = 0.52$ |\n| $r_{m,y2}$ | c   |   $0.19$   |\n| $r_{x,y1}$ | ab + g | $(0.46 \\times 0.38) + 0.31 = 0.49$ |\n| $r_{x,y2}$ | ac    |  $0.46 \\times 0.19 = 0.09$  |\n| $r_{y1,y2}$ | bc + gac | $(0.38 \\times 0.19) + (0.31 \\times 0.46 \\times 0.19) = 0.10$  |\n\nAnd now, when we look at our observed covariance matrix, we are doing a much better job of recreating it, than we did with the model from Example 2!  \n```{r}\ncov(egdata2) |> round(2)\n```\n\n:::\n::::\n\n:::\n\n# Education and Salary\n\n\n:::frame\n\n```{r}\n#| include: false\nlibrary(lavaan)\nset.seed(777)\ndf = tibble::tibble(\n  Educ = round(rnorm(390, 15.5, 3)),\n  Skill = round(scale(.6*scale(Educ) + rnorm(390))[,1],2),\n  Salary = scale(.12*scale(Educ) + .3*Skill + rnorm(390,0,1))[,1]*12.3 + 39.533\n)\n# readr::write_csv(df,file=\"../../data/edskill.csv\")\n# m=\"\n# Salary ~ c*Educ + b*Skill\n# Skill ~ a*Educ\n# ind:=a*b\n# total:=a*b+c\n# \"\n# sem(m, df) |> summary()\n#lm(Salary ~ Educ + Skill,df) |> summary()\n  \n\n```\n\nWe sampled 500 people who were all 5 years out of their last year of education. All participants completed an extensive questionnaire to ascertain the number of and expertise in any skills that may be of potential interest to employers. This resulted in a \"Skillset Metric\". 5 years later, participants were followed up and asked to provide their current salaries. 110 participants failed to respond to follow-ups and thus the final sample included 390 people.  \n\nThe data are available at [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/edskill.csv](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/edskill.csv){target=\"_blank\"}.  \n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\ntibble(\n  variable = names(df),\n  description = c(\n    \"Number of years of education undertaken\",\n    \"Skillset metric (standardised score obtained via a 100 item questionnaire measuring the number of, and expertise in, any skills deemed relevant to employers)\",\n    \"Salary (in thousands of £)\"\n  )\n) |> gt::gt()\n```\n\n:::\n\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`\nRead in the dataset.  \nLet's suppose that the only statistical machinery available to us is the good old regression models with `lm()`, and we are interested in the estimated effect of education on salary.    \n\nWhich model are you going to fit?  \n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nlm(Salary ~ Educ, data = ... )\nlm(Salary ~ Skill + Educ, data = ... )\n```\n\n\n`r qend()`\n`r solbegin(show=TRUE, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nHere's the data: \n```{r}\nedskill <- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/edskill.csv\")\n```\n\nI'm going to fit both models so that we can discuss them below\n```{r}\nm1 <- lm(Salary ~ Educ, data = edskill)\nm2 <- lm(Salary ~ Skill + Educ, data = edskill)\n# model tables side by side\nsjPlot::tab_model(m1,m2)\n```\n\nSo we have got two quite different pictures. The first model says that for every additional year of education, the salary offered would be £1070 more. The second model says it would only be £480 more, and it looks like skills are a lot more important than education is for getting a good salary, right?  \n\nBut this makes it sound like Education and Skills are things that we can compare the effects of independently. The implicit model we are referring to when using `lm(Salary ~ Skill + Educ)` is in the left hand diagram, Model A, of @fig-educ. But does it not make a lot more sense to think that Education is a cause of peoples' skill level (especially as the skill level being measured 5 years after their last year of education precludes the opposite direction). In other words, does Model B in @fig-educ not make more sense?  \n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: \"100%\"\n#| label: fig-educ\n#| fig-cap: \"Two theoretical models of process that gives rise to the data\"\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/path_educ.png\")\n```\n\n::::{.columns}\n:::{.column width=\"80%\"}\nWhat Model B suggests is that part of *how* education influences peoples' salaries is by giving them more skills. A perfect example is that you are all now on your way to becoming proficient R users! \n:::\n:::{.column width=\"5%\"}\n:::\n:::{.column width=\"15%\"}\n![](images/new-skill-unlocked.gif)\n:::\n::::\n\nThis is a great example that illustrates instances we might **not** want to include a variable in our model. If you are interested in \"what does having an extra year of education do for peoples' salaries?\", then controlling for skill in our model actually _removes_ that part of the mechanism by which education influences salary.  \n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n#### another example\n\nTo make this point super clear, suppose we were testing some drug that reduces blood pressure in order to lower the risk of cardiac arrest. \nWe do an experiment where we gave some people the drug, and some people a placebo, then after a year we measured their blood pressure, and then we followed up 5 years later to see how many experienced cardiac arrests.  \n\nThe diagram to show how these variable relate is clearly the one in @fig-pathdrugmed  \n```{r}\n#| label: fig-pathdrugmed\n#| fig-cap: \"A drug aimed at reducing cardiac arrests by lowering blood pressure. The faint grey line indicates the path that would be estimated if we attempted to control for post-treatment blood-pressure\"\n#| echo: false\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/path_drug.png\")\n```\n\nIf we fitted the model `lm(cardiac_arrest ~ blood_pressure + drug)`, then the estimated coefficient we get for `drug` will be the effect of the drug on cardiac arrests that *isn't* due to how it changes blood pressure. But that is exactly the opposite of what we want, because we think the drug works specifically by lowering blood pressure!  \n\nContrast this with another example, where we do not run an experiment and allocate people into \"drug\" or \"placebo\", we simply observe a whole load of people who either do or do not take the drug, and we follow them up to see how many have cardiac arrests. **But**, it is generally older people who take the drug, whereas younger people do not. In addition, older people have a higher risk of cardiac arrests. So our model is that seen in @fig-pathdrugcon.  \n```{r}\n#| label: fig-pathdrugcon\n#| fig-cap: \"We are interested in a drug aimed at reducing cardiac arrests. Older people are more likely to take the drug, and are also more likely to experience cardiac arrest\"\n#| echo: false\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/path_drug_con.png\")\n```\n\nIn this case, controlling for the third variable `age` is the right thing to do.  \nIf we do not control for age, and fit the model `lm(cardiac_arrest ~ drug)`, then the coefficient for `drug` will be biased because the group who take the drug are on average older, and thus will tend to experience more cardiac arrests. If the imbalance of age between the drug and no-drug groups is great enough, it could even look like the drug is making cardiac arrests _more_ likely!  \n\n:::\n\n`r solend()`\n\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`\nInstead, let's suppose we are actually interested in the mechanism of _how_ education influences salary. Do more educated people tend to have higher salaries in part because of the skills obtained during their education?  \n\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Direct, Indirect and Total effects\n\nIn path diagrams:\n\n- Direct effect = one single-headed arrow between the two variables concerned  \n- Indirect effect = An effect transmitted via some other variables   \n\nIf we have a variable $X$ that we take to 'cause' variable $Y$, then our path diagram will look like @fig-total, which path $c$ is the __total effect__.

A path diagram representing this theoretical idea of 'mediation' is shown in @fig-indirect. In this case, path $c'$ is the __direct effect__, and paths $a$ and $b$ make up the __indirect effect__.  \n\n```{r echo=FALSE}\n#| echo: false\n#| label: fig-indirect\n#| fig-cap: \"The effect of X on Y is partly mediated by M\"\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/MED2.png\")\n```\n\n\nYou will find in some areas people talk about the ideas of __\"complete\"__ vs __\"partial\"__ mediation.\n\n- __Complete mediation__ is when $X$ does not influence $Y$ other than its influence through $M$ (therefore path $c'$ would not be significantly different from zero). \n- __Partial mediation__ is when the path from $X$ to $Y$ is _reduced in magnitude_ when the mediator $M$ is introduced, _but still different from zero._  \n- The __Proportion Mediated__ is the amount of the total effect of $X$ to $Y$ that goes via $M$. i.e. $\\frac{a \\times b}{c}$ in the images above. \n\n:::\n\n\nFit a path model in which education has an effect on salary both directly and indirectly, via its influence on the skills  obtained.  \n\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Hints\n\nA path model is essential a _set_ of equations.

However, this results in the estimated indirect effect rarely following a normal distribution, and makes our usual analytically derived standard errors & p-values inappropriate.   \n\nInstead, bootstrapping has become the norm for assessing sampling distributions of indirect effects in mediation models (remember, bootstrapping involves resampling the data with replacement, thousands of times, in order to empirically generate a sampling distribution).  \n\nWe can do this easily in lavaan:\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nmod.est <- sem(model_formula, data=my_data, se = \"bootstrap\") \n# to print out the confidence intervals:\nsummary(mod.est, ci = TRUE)\n```\n\n:::\n\n`r qend()`\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n# save(mod.est,mod1.est,model1.est,model2.est,file=\"data/pathmods.rdata\")\nload(\"data/pathmods.rdata\")\n```\n\nNote that we get a warning here, but it's not too much to worry about. It tells us that 8 (out of 1000) of the bootstraps has failed to converge. This means our bootstrapped estimates are really based on 992 bootstrap draws (and so a write up would need to clearly report this).  \nIf this number was bigger (e.g. 10% or 20% of the bootstraps failed) then we it would be more of a cause for concern.  \n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nmod1.est <- sem(mod1, data = edskill, se = \"bootstrap\")\n```\n<p style=\"color:red;font-size:0.8em\">Warning message:<br>\nIn lav_model_nvcov_bootstrap(lavmodel = lavmodel, lavsamplestats = lavsamplestats,  :<br>\n  lavaan WARNING: 8 bootstrap runs failed or did not converge.</p>\n\n```{r}\nsummary(mod1.est, ci = TRUE)\n```\n\n```{r}\n#| include: false\nres = partable(mod1.est)$est[\n  partable(mod1.est)$lhs %in% c(\"indirect\",\"total\")] |>\n  round(2)\n\nres2 = summary(mod1.est, ci=TRUE)$pe\nres2 = round(res2[res2$lhs==\"indirect\",c(\"est\",\"ci.lower\",\"ci.upper\")],2)\n```\n\nThe relationship between education and salary **is** mediated by skill level!

X$\\rightarrow$M$\\rightarrow$Y will fit your data just as well as X$\\rightarrow$Y$\\rightarrow$M or Y$\\rightarrow$M$\\rightarrow$X! \n- **Perfect reliability of M:** The mediator is measured without error\n- **No X-M interaction:** The effect of the mediator M on the outcome Y does not depend on the level of the predictor X. \n- **No confounding:** A variable that is a common cause of both X and Y will bias the total and direct effects, and a variable that is a common cause of both X and M will bias the indirect effect (it will bias the X$\\rightarrow$M path). Randomised experiments (i.e. randomly allocating people to different values of X) will avoid the first two, because nothing but the random allocation would cause X. However, confounding of the indirect effect can also happen if some variable is a common cause of both M and Y, and it is hard to randomly allocate to a mediator^[there _are_ methods that attempt to \"block\" a mediator, or to manipulate X in multiple ways in order to increase or decrease the mediators' effect. If you're interested see [*Design approaches to experimental mediation*, Pirlott & MacKinnon 2016](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jesp.2015.09.012){target=\"_blank\"}].  \n\nThink of two unmeasured variables that could be in the place of the variables indicated by `?` in @fig-blanks and may be confounding our estimates.  \n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| label: fig-blanks\n#| fig-cap: \"fill in the blanks!\"  \nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/path_educ_conf_blank.png\")\n```\n\n\n`r qend()`\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nHere are my suggestions. Even if we don't believe that it _should_, something like \"socioeconomic status\" can likely influence both peoples' levels of education (people from wealthier backgrounds have more access to more years of education) and their eventual salary (social connections might lead to better paying jobs, etc.).  \nSimilarly, aspects of peoples' employment post-education will influence the skills they have _and_ their salary. For instance, some people might leave education and go into private industry jobs with lots of options for on-the-job training and 'upskilling'. These jobs might also generally pay higher salaries! \n```{r}\n#| echo: false\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/path_educ_conf_example.png\")\n```\n\n`r solend()`\n\n<!-- `r qbegin(qcounter())` -->\n<!-- Thinking point (no need to _do_ anything) - what would an \"X-M interaction\" look like in this example? -->\n\n<!-- `r qend()` -->\n<!-- `r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)` -->\n\n<!-- In our example of Educ$\\rightarrow$Skill$\\rightarrow$Salary, the \"X-M interaction\" would refer to if skills has a different effect on salary depending on the level of education. -->\n\n<!-- Intuitively to me this actually seems like a pretty important point here.

We collected data on 557 adolescents as they entered school. Their responses to the conduct problem scale were averaged and scaled to create a standardised score. Two years later, we followed up these students, and obtained measures of Academic performance and of their relationship quality with their teachers. Standardised scale scores were created for both of these measures.  \n\nThe data are available at [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/cprobteach.csv](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/cprobteach.csv){target=\"_blank\"}  \n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\ncp_teach<-read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/cprobteach.csv\")\n\ntibble(\n  variable = names(cp_teach),\n  description = c(\n    \"participant ID\",\n    \"Academic performance (standardised score based on all available assessments)\",\n    \"Teacher relationship quality (standardised score based on the Teacher-Child-Relationship (TCR) scale)\",\n    \"Non-Aggressive conduct problems (standardised score score based on items 1-5 of the 10 item conduct problems scale)\",\n    \"Aggressive conduct problems (standardised score score based on items 6-10 of the 10 item conduct problems scale)\"\n  )\n) |> gt::gt()\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`\nAs a little exercise before we get started, let's just show ourselves that we can use __lavaan__ to estimate all sorts of models, including a multiple regression model. \n\nThe code below fits the same model using `sem()` and using `lm()`.

In the model, academic performance was regressed on teacher relationship quality, non-aggressive conduct problems and aggressive conduct problems while teacher relationship quality (the mediator) was regressed on aggressive and non-aggressive conduct problems. The indirect effects were tested using the product of the coefficient for the regression of outcome on mediator and the coefficient for the regression of mediator on predictor. The statistical significance of the indirect effects were evaluated using bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals with 1000 bootstrap samples.\n\nUnstandardised parameter estimates are provided in @fig-pathcp. Solid lines indicate that a parameter is significant at the 5% significance level, while dashed lines represent non-significant paths.The indirect effects of both non-aggressive  ($b = -0.09,\\, 95\\%\\, CI\\, [-0.14, -0.05]$) and aggressive ($b = -0.15,\\, 95\\%\\, CI\\, [-0.22, 0.08]$) conduct problems on academic performance were statistically significant. \n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-pathcp\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: \"1200px\"\n#| fig-cap: \"Effect of conduct problems on academic performance mediated by quality of teacher relationship.\"\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/path_analy_rev.png\")\n```\n:::\n\n`r solend()`\n\n\n<br><br>\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n## optional: mediation using separate models\n\nFollowing [Baron & Kenny 1986](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.917.2326&rep=rep1&type=pdf), we can conduct mediation analysis in a simpler way by using three separate regression models.  \n\n1. $y \\sim x$\n2. $m \\sim x$\n3. $y \\sim x + m$\n\nStep 1. Assess the total effect of the predictor on the outcome `y ~ x`. This step establishes that there *is* an effect that may be mediated.    \n```{r}\nmod1 <- lm(Salary ~ Educ, data = edskill)\nsummary(mod1)$coefficients\n```\n\nStep 2. Estimate the effect of the predictor on the mediator `m ~ x`:\n```{r}\nmod2 <- lm(Skill ~ Educ, data = edskill)\nsummary(mod2)$coefficients\n```\n\nStep 3. Estimate the effects of the predictor and mediator on the outcome `y ~ x + m`. We need to show that the mediator affects the outcome variable. \n```{r}\nmod3 <- lm(Salary ~ Educ + Skill, data = edskill)\nsummary(mod3)$coefficients\n```\n\nStep 4. If Steps 1-3 all show effects of `y~x`, `m~x` and `y~m|x`^[read `y~m|x` as `y~m` controlling for `x`] respectively, then we can assess mediation. We need to look at the how effect of the predictor on the outcome changes when we control for the mediator. This is from the same third model above. If the effect of the predictor is reduced, then we have mediation. If it is now zero, then we have complete mediation.  \n\nThis method is generally less optimal than using path models. Following the \"separate models\" approach^[sometimes referred to as \"steps approach\"] and requiring certain effects to be significant can sometimes lead to erroneous conclusions. For example, if `Y ~ 2*M + -2*X` and `M ~ 1*X`, then the total effect of `Y~X` would be $(2 \\times 1) + -2 = 0$, leading us to say that there is no effect that could be mediated! In part the problems with this approach are because it doesn't actually *estimate* the indirect effects, and attempts to determine \"is there mediation [Yes]/[No]?\" based on the significance of the individual paths. Even if the total effect $c$ is significantly different from zero and the direct effect $c'$ is not, this does not imply that the coefficients $c$ and $c'$ are different from one another! We therefore need to conduct an extra step (a popular approach is the \"Sobel's test\") in order to asses whether $c-c'=0$, or to estimate the $ab$ path via bootstrapping like we do in __lavaan__.  \n\nPerhaps a more relevant issue is that the separate models approach cannot so easily be generalised to situations with multiple mediators, multiple outcomes, or multiple predictors, whereas a path analytic approach can. In addition, both are susceptible to the same concerns of measurement reliability, confounding, predictor-mediator interactions, and the causal directions between variables.   \n\n<!-- ::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"} -->\n<!-- #### Optional - packages for estimating mediation effects -->\n\n<!-- The __mediation__ package is a very nice approach that allows us to conduct mediation this way, and it also extends to allow us to have categorical variables (we can use a logistic regression as one of our models), or to have multilevel data (our models can be fitted using __lme4__).   -->\n\n<!-- ```{r} -->\n<!-- library(mediation) -->\n<!-- mymediation <- mediate(model.m = mod2,  -->\n<!--                        model.y = mod3,  -->\n<!--                        treat='religiosity',  -->\n<!--                        mediator='hlc', -->\n<!--                        boot=TRUE, sims=500) -->\n\n<!-- summary(mymediation) -->\n<!-- ``` -->\n\n<!-- - ACME: Average Causal Mediation Effects (the indirect path $\\mathbf{a \\times b}$ in @fig-medpaths).   -->\n<!-- - ADE: Average Direct Effects (the direct path $\\mathbf{c'}$ in @fig-medpaths).   -->\n<!-- - Total Effect: sum of the mediation (indirect) effect and the direct effect (this is $\\mathbf{(a \\times b) + c)}$ in @fig-medpaths).   -->\n\n<!-- ```{r} -->\n<!-- #| echo: false -->\n<!-- #| label: fig-medpaths -->\n<!-- #| fig-cap: \"Mediation Model.
