By representing a theoretical model as paths to and from different variables, we open up a whole new way of thinking about how we model the world around us. These _\"path diagrams\"_ have different shapes and symbols to denote the covariances, regressions, observed variables and latent variables.  \n\n- **Observed variables** are represented by squares or rectangles. These are the named variables of interest which exist in our dataset - i.e. the ones which we have measured directly. \n- **Latent variables** are represented as ovals/ellipses or circles. These are unobserved variables that we can only reason about and have not (or cannot) directly measured.  \n- **Covariances** are represented by double-headed arrows. In many diagrams these are curved.  \n- **Regressions** are shown by single headed arrows (e.g., an arrow from $x$ to $y$ for the path $y \\sim x$). **Factor loadings** are also regression paths - specifying a factor structure is simply to say that some measured variables $y_1\\,,\\, ...\\, ,\\, y_k$ are each regressed onto some unmeasured factor(s). The formula $y_1 = \\lambda_1 \\cdot F + u_1$ looks an awful lot like $y = b \\cdot x + \\epsilon$, we just do not observe $F$!.  \n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| label: fig-diagsem\n#| fig-cap: \"Path/SEM diagrams contain various shapes and symbols to represent different types of variable and the relationships between them.\"\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/semdiag.png\")\n```\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n#### PCA as a diagram\n\nPCA represented as a diagram.

This structure simplifies the interpretation of factors, making them more distinct and easily understandable. With oblique rotations, we also allow factors to be correlated, as indicated by the double headed arrow between them in the diagram below\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: \"100%\"\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/diag_efa2.png\")\n```\n\n:::\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n#### CFA as a diagram\n\nThe diagram for a Confirmatory Factor Analysis model looks very similar to that of an exploratory factor analysis, but we now have the explicit absence of some arrows - i.e. a variable loads on to a specific factor (or factor**s** - we can have a variable that loads on multiple), and **not** on others.  \n\nNote that this is a change from the 'exploratory' nature of EFA, to a situation in which we are explicitly imposing a theoretical model on the data.  \n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: \"100%\"\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/diag_cfa.png\")\n```\n\n:::\n\n\n# conduct problems\n\n:::frame\n__Data: Conduct Problems Dataset2__  \n\nLast week we conducted an exploratory factor analysis of a dataset to try and identify an optimal factor structure for a new measure of conduct (i.e., antisocial behavioural) problems.

This is because as our models become more complex, our formulas can pretty long!   \n\nIn lavaan, it is typical to write the model as a character string (e.g. `model <- \"y ~ x1 + x2\"`) and then we pass that formula along with the data to the relevant __lavaan__ function such as `cfa()` or `sem()`, giving it the formula and the data: `cfa(model, data = mydata)`.  \n\n1.
