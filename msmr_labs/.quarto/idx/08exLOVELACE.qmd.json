By representing a theoretical model as paths to and from different variables, we open up a whole new way of thinking about how we model the world around us. These _\"path diagrams\"_ have different shapes and symbols to denote the covariances, regressions, observed variables and latent variables.  \n\n- **Observed variables** are represented by squares or rectangles. These are the named variables of interest which exist in our dataset - i.e. the ones which we have measured directly. \n- **Latent variables** are represented as ovals/ellipses or circles. These are unobserved variables that we can only reason about and have not (or cannot) directly measured.  \n- **Covariances** are represented by double-headed arrows. In many diagrams these are curved.  \n- **Regressions** are shown by single headed arrows (e.g., an arrow from $x$ to $y$ for the path $y \\sim x$). **Factor loadings** are also regression paths - specifying a factor structure is simply to say that some measured variables $y_1\\,,\\, ...\\, ,\\, y_k$ are each regressed onto some unmeasured factor(s). The formula $y_1 = \\lambda_1 \\cdot F + u_1$ looks an awful lot like $y = b \\cdot x + \\epsilon$, we just do not observe $F$!.  \n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| label: fig-diagsem\n#| fig-cap: \"Path/SEM diagrams contain various shapes and symbols to represent different types of variable and the relationships between them.\"\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/semdiag.png\")\n```\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n#### PCA as a diagram\n\n__Used for:__  \nReducing from a lot of correlated variables down to a smaller set of orthogonal (uncorrelated) components that capture a substantial amount of the variance. The components we get out are a bit like \"composites\" - they are a weighted sum of the original variables, and can be useful in subsequent analyses. For instance, if you have 20 predictors in a linear regression model that are highly correlated with one another (remember multicollinearity?), you might be able to instead use a small number of orthogonal components! \n\n__As a diagram__  \nNote that the idea of a 'composite' requires us to use a special shape (the hexagon), but many people would just use a square.\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: \"100%\"\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/diag_pca.png\")\n```\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n#### optional: PCA in full\n\nPrincipal components sequentially capture the orthogonal (i.e., perpendicular) dimensions of the dataset with the most variance. The data reduction comes when we retain fewer components than we have dimensions in our original data. So if we were being pedantic, the diagram for PCA would look something like the diagram below. If the idea of 'dimensions' of a dataset is still a bit confusing, you can see a fun 3-dimensional explanation here: [PCA in 3D](00_pca.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: \"100%\"\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/diag_pca2.png\")\n```\n\n:::\n\n:::\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n#### EFA as a diagram\n\n__Used for:__  \nEFA is generally used with the aim of understanding the underlying constructs or latent variables that may be driving observed patterns of responses or behaviors. Often used in construction of questionnaires, scale development, and in the initial stages of developing theoretical frameworks.  \n\n__As a diagram__  \nExploratory Factor Analysis as a diagram has arrows going from the factors to the observed variables. Unlike PCA, we also have 'uniqueness' factors for each variable, representing the various stray causes that are specific to each variable. Sometimes, these uniqueness are represented by an arrow only, but they are technically themselves latent variables, and so can be drawn as circles. \n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: \"100%\"\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/diag_efa1.png\")\n```\n\nWhen we apply a rotation to an EFA, we make it so that some loadings are smaller and some are higher - essentially creating a 'simple structure' (where each variable loads strongly on only one factor and weakly on all other factors). This structure simplifies the interpretation of factors, making them more distinct and easily understandable. With oblique rotations, we also allow factors to be correlated, as indicated by the double headed arrow between them in the diagram below\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: \"100%\"\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/diag_efa2.png\")\n```\n\n:::\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n#### CFA as a diagram\n\n__Used for:__  \nCFA is a method that allows us to assess the validity of a hypothesized factor structure (or to compare competing hypothesized structures). Typically factor structures fitted are ones that have been proposed based on theory or on previous research. \n\n__As a diagram__  \nThe diagram for a Confirmatory Factor Analysis model looks very similar to that of an exploratory factor analysis, but we now have the explicit absence of some arrows - i.e. a variable loads on to a specific factor (or factor**s** - we can have a variable that loads on multiple), and **not** on others.  \n\nNote that this is a change from the 'exploratory' nature of EFA, to a situation in which we are explicitly imposing a theoretical model on the data.  \n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: \"100%\"\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/diag_cfa.png\")\n```\n\n:::\n\n\n# Conduct Problems \n\n:::frame\n__Data: conduct_problems_2.csv__  \n\nLast week we conducted an exploratory factor analysis of a dataset to try and identify an optimal factor structure for a new measure of conduct (i.e., antisocial behavioural) problems. \n\nThis week, we'll conduct some confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) of the same inventory to assess the extent to which this 2-factor structure fits an independent sample. To do this, we have administered our measure to a new sample of n=600 adolescents. \n\nWe have re-ordered the questionnaire items to be grouped into the two types of behaviours:\n\n::::{.columns}\n:::{.column width=\"47.5%\"}\n__Non-Aggressive Behaviours__  \n```{r}\n#| echo: false\ntibble(\n  type = rep(c(\"non-aggressive\",\"aggressive\"),e=5),\n  item = paste0(\"item \",1:10),\n  behaviour = c(\"Stealing\",\"Lying\",\"Skipping school\",\"Vandalism\",\"Breaking curfew\",\"Threatening others\",\"Bullying\",\"Spreading malicious rumours\",\"Using a weapon \",\"Fighting\")\n) |> filter(grepl(\"non\",type)) |> select(-type) |>\n  knitr::kable() |>\n  kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = TRUE)\n```\n:::\n:::{.column width=\"5%\"}\n:::\n:::{.column width=\"47.5%\"}\n__Aggressive Behaviours__  \n```{r}\n#| echo: false\ntibble(\n  type = rep(c(\"non-aggressive\",\"aggressive\"),e=5),\n  item = paste0(\"item \",1:10),\n  behaviour = c(\"Stealing\",\"Lying\",\"Skipping school\",\"Vandalism\",\"Breaking curfew\",\"Threatening others\",\"Bullying\",\"Spreading malicious rumours\",\"Using a weapon \",\"Fighting\")\n) |> filter(!grepl(\"non\",type)) |> select(-type) |>\n  knitr::kable() |>\n  kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = TRUE)\n```\n:::\n::::\n\nThe data are available as a **.csv** at [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/conduct_problems_2.csv](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/conduct_problems_2.csv) \n\n:::\n\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`\nRead in the data.

Instead of including the model formula *inside* the fit function (e.g., `lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = df)`), we tend to do it in a step-by-step process. This is because as our models become more complex, our formulas can pretty long!   \n\nIn lavaan, it is typical to write the model as a character string (e.g. `model <- \"y ~ x1 + x2\"`) and then we pass that formula along with the data to the relevant __lavaan__ function such as `cfa()` or `sem()`, giving it the formula and the data: `cfa(model, data = mydata)`.  \n\n1. Specify the model:  \n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nmymodel <- \"\n  factor1 =~ item1 + item2 + .....\n  factor2 =~ item6 + ...... \n  ...\n  ..\n\"\n```\n2. Estimate the model (other fitting functions include `sem()`, `growth()` and `lavaan()`):\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nmyfittedmodel <- cfa(mymodel, data = mydata)\n```\n3. Examine the fitted model: \n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nsummary(myfittedmodel)\n```\n\nThe output of the `summary()` will show you each estimated parameter in your model. It groups these according to whether they are loadings onto latent variables, covariances, regressions, variances etc.  \n:::\n  \n`r qend()`\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(lavaan)\ncpmod <- \"\n  # the non-aggressive problems factor\n  nonagg =~ item1 + item2 + item3 + item4 + item5\n\n  # the aggressive problems factor\n  agg =~ item6 + item7 + item8 + item9 + item10\n\n  # covariance between the two factors\n  # (this is included by default in cfa)\n  agg ~~ nonagg\n\"\n\ncpmod.est <- cfa(cpmod, data = cp2)\n\nsummary(cpmod.est)\n```\n\n`r solend()`\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`\nLatent variable models like CFA come with a whole bucket load of 'fit indices' as metrics of how well our model is reflecting the observed data.  \n\nWe can get out these indices by either asking for the most common fit indices to be printed inside all of our summary output:  \n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nsummary(myfittedmodel, fit.measures = TRUE)\n```\nOr by asking for _all_ available indices with:\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nfitmeasures(myfittedmodel)\n# to get just a select few, we can index the desired ones:\nfitmeasures(myfittedmodel)[c(\"rmsea\",\"srmr\",\"tli\",\"cfi\")]\n```\n\nExamine the fit of the 2-factor model of conduct problems to this new sample of 600 adolescents.  \n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n#### \"Model Fit\" \n\nYou'll have heard the term \"model fit\" many times when learning about statistics. However, the exact meaning of the phrase is different for different modelling frameworks.\n\nWe can think more generally as \"model fit\" as asking \"how well does our model reproduce the characteristics of the data that we observed?\". In things like multiple regression, this has been tied to the question of \"how much variance can we explain in outcome $y$ with our set of predictors?\"^[or in logistic regression, \"what is the likelihood of observing the outcome $y$ given our model parameters?\"].  \n\nFor methods like CFA, path analysis and SEM, we are working with models that run on covariances matrices, so \"model fit\" becomes \"how well can our model reproduce our observed covariance matrix?\".   \n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Degrees of Freedom\n\nIn regression, we could only talk about model fit if we had more than 2 datapoints. This is because there is only one possible line that we can fit between 2 datapoints, and this line explains _all_ of the variance in the outcome variable (it uses up all our 2 degrees of freedom to estimate 1) the intercept and 2) the slope).   \n\nThe logic is the same for model fit in terms of CFA and SEM - we need more degrees of freedom than we have parameters that are estimated. \n\nThe difference is that it is all in terms of our covariance matrix, rather than individual observations. The idea is that we need to be estimating fewer paths (e.g. parameters) than there are variances/covariances in our covariance matrix. This is because if we just fit paths between all our variables, then our model would be able to reproduce the data perfectly (just like a regression with 2 datapoints has an $R^2$ of 1).  \n\n\nThe degrees of freedom for methods like CFA, Path and SEM, that are fitted to the covariance matrix of our data, correspond to the number of *knowns* (observed covariances/variances from our sample) minus the number of *unknowns* (parameters to be estimated by the model). \n\n- **degrees of freedom = number of knowns - number of unknowns**  \n  - number of knowns: how many variances/covariances in our data?  \n  The number of knowns in a covariance matrix of $k$ observed variables is equal to $\\frac{k \\cdot (k+1)}{2}$.  \n  - number of unknowns: how many parameters is our model estimating?  \n  We can reduce the number of unknowns (thereby getting back a degree of freedom) by fixing parameters to be specific values. *By removing a path altogether, we are fixing it to be zero.*  \n\nA model is only able to be estimated if it has at least 0 degrees of freedom (if there are as many knowns as unknowns). A model with 0 degrees of freedom is termed **just-identified**. An **under-identified** model is one with $<0$ degrees of freedom, and an **over-identified** one has $>0$ degrees of freedom.  \n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Fit Indices\n\nThere are _loads_ of different metrics that people use to examine model fit for CFA and SEM, and there's lots of debate over the various merits and disadvantages as well as the proposed cut-offs to be used with each method.  \n\nThe most fundamental test of model fit is a $\\chi^2$ test, which reflects the discrepancy between our observed covariance matrix and the *model-implied* covariance matrix. If we denote the population covariance matrix as $\\Sigma$ and the model-implied covariance matrix as $\\Sigma(\\Theta)$, then we can think of the null hypothesis here as $H_0: \\Sigma - \\Sigma(\\Theta) = 0$. In this way our null hypothesis is that our theoretical model is correct (and can therefore perfectly reproduce the covariance matrix), therefore a significant result indicates _poor_ fit. It is very sensitive to departures from normality, as well as sample size (for models with $n>400$, the $\\chi^2$ is almost always significant), and can often lead to rejecting otherwise adequate models.  \n\nAlongside this, the main four fit indices that are commonly used are known as RMSEA, SRMR, CFI and TLI. Smaller values of RMSEA and SRMR mean better fit while larger values of CFI and TLI mean better fit.  \n\n**Convention:** if $\\textrm{RMSEA} < .05$, $\\textrm{SRMR} < .05$, $\\textrm{TLI} > .95$ and $\\textrm{CFI} > .95$ then the model fits well.  \n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n#### optional: absolute fit indices\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: \"100%\"\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/fitmeas_abs.PNG\")\n```\n\n:::\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n#### optional: incremental fit indices\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: \"100%\"\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/fitmeas_inc.PNG\")\n```\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n\n`r qend()`\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nOur model fits well by all metrics!  \n```{r}\nfitmeasures(cpmod.est)[c(\"srmr\",\"rmsea\",\"cfi\",\"tli\")]\n```\n\n\n`r solend()`\n\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`\nTake a look at the loadings of our variables on to the latent factors (these are in the `estimate` column under \"Latent Variables\" in the `summary()`).  \n\nIn EFA, our factor loadings were always <1, because they were _standardised_ loadings (where the factor and item were both standardised to have a variance of 1). Because a latent variable is unobserved, it's actually up to us how we define its scale! \nIn CFA, the default is to make it have the same scale as its first item, which is why the first loading for each factor is exactly 1, and has no standard error associated with it - it's _fixed_, rather than estimated.  \n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Latent Variable Scaling\n\nin @fig-df1, we can see a the model of a latent factor loading on to 4 items. The number of paths to be estimated here is greater than the number of known covariances. However, we can get around this by *fixing certain parameters to be specific values*. In @fig-df2, the latent factor variance is set at 1, and the residual factor loadings are also set to 1.  \nThis has the additional benefit of making our latent factor have some defining features. Because we don't actually measure the latent variable (it is a hypothetical construct), it doesn't really have any intrinsic 'scale'. When we fix the variance to be 1, we are providing some property (its variance) we create a reference from which the other paths to/from the variable are in relation to. A common alternative is to fix the factor loading of the first item to be 1 (see @fig-df3).\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| label: fig-df1\n#| fig-cap: \"A four item factor structure.

Items 1-5 loaded on a 'non-aggressive conduct problems' factor and items 6-10 loaded on an 'aggression' factor and these factors were allowed to correlate. Scaling and identification were achieved by fixing the loading of item 1 on the non-aggressive conduct problems factor and item 6 on the aggression factor to 1.

It was developed to measure 2 separate domains of online obsession: items 1 to 9 are representative of the \"emotional\" relationships people have with their internet usage (i.e. how it makes them feel), and items 10 to 15 reflect \"practical\" relationship (i.e., how it connects or interferes with their day-to-day life). Each item is measured on a 7-point likert scale from \"strongly disagree\" to \"strongly agree\".  \n\nWe administered this scale to 476 participants in order to assess the validity of the 2 domain structure of the online obsession measure that we obtained during scale development.  \n\nThe data are available at [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/doom.csv](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/doom.csv){target=\"_blank\"}, and the table below shows the individual item wordings.  \n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\ndoom <- read_csv(\"../../data/doom.csv\")\ntibble(\n  variable = names(doom),\n  question = c(\"i just can't stop watching videos of animals\",\n\"i spend hours scrolling through tutorials but never actually attempt any projects.\",\n\"cats are my main source of entertainment.\",\n\"life without the internet would be boring, empty, and joyless\",\n\"i try to hide how long i’ve been online\",\n\"i avoid thinking about things by scrolling on the internet\",\n\"everything i see online is either sad or terrifying\",\n\"all the negative stuff online makes me feel better about my own life\",\n\"i feel better the more 'likes' i receive\",\n\"most of my time online is spent communicating with others\",\n\"my work suffers because of the amount of time i spend online\",\n\"i spend a lot of time online for work\",\n\"i check my emails very regularly\",\n\"others in my life complain about the amount of time i spend online\",\n\"i neglect household chores to spend more time online\")\n) |> gt::gt()\n```\n\n:::\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`\nAssess whether the 2 domain model of online obsession provides a good fit to the validation sample of 476 participants.   \n`r qend()`\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nFrom the visual of the correlation matrix, you can see the vague outline of two groups of items correlations.

Note that this would still be in a sense _exploratory,_ and we should be very clear when writing up about the process that we undertook. We should also avoid just shoving any parameter in that might make it fit better - we should let common sense and theoretical knowledge support any adjustments we make.  \n\nThe `modindices()` function takes a fitted model object from __lavaan__ and provides a table of all the possible additional parameters we _could_ estimate.  \n\nThe output is a table, which we can ask to be sorted according to the `mi` column using `sort = TRUE`.  \n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nmodindices(myfittedmodel, sort = TRUE)\n```\n```\n      lhs op    rhs     mi    epc sepc.lv sepc.all sepc.nox\n72  item6 ~~ item10 10.747  0.082   0.082    0.144    0.144\n25 fact1  =~  item7  8.106  0.119   0.080    0.080    0.080\n65  item5 ~~  item7  6.720  0.039   0.039    0.160    0.160\n71  item6 ~~  item9  6.675 -0.065  -0.065   -0.115   -0.115\n.   ...   .   ...    ...    ...     ...      ...      ...\n```\n\nThe columns show:  \n\n| `lhs`,`op`,`rhs`  | `mi`  | `epc` | `sepc.lv`, `sepc.all`,`sepc.nox`    |\n| --------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |\n| these three columns show the specific parameter, in lavaan syntax. So `fact1 =~ item7` is for the possible inclusion of `item7` being loaded on to the latent variable `fact1`. `item6 ~~ item10` is for the inclusion of a covariance between `item6` and `item10`, and so on. | \"modification index\" = the change in the model $\\chi^2$ value _were we to include this parameter in the model_ | \"expected parameter change\" = the estimated value that the parameter _would take were it included in the model_ | these provide the `epc` values but scaled to when a) the latent variables are standardised, b) all variables are standardised, and c) all except exogenous observed variables are standardised (not relevant for CFA) |\n\n\nOften, the `sepc.all`is a useful column to look at, because it shows the proposed parameter estimate in a standardised metric. i.e. if the `op` is `~~`, then the `sepc.all` value is a correlation, and so we can consider anything <.2/.3ish to be quite small.

For instance, suggested residual covariances, representing unexplained covariation among observed variables, may indicate misspecification in the initial model. \n- The structure of the construct is genuinely different in your population from the initial one in which the scale is developed (this could be a research question in and of itself - i.e. does the structure of \"anxiety\" differ as people age, or differ between cultures?)\n\nModifications to a CFA model should be made judiciously, with careful consideration of theory as well as quantitative metrics. The goal is to develop a model that accurately represents the underlying structure of the data while maintaining theoretical coherence and generalizability.  \n\n:::\n\nIn this case, the likely reason for the poor fit of the \"DOOM\" scale, is that the person who made the items (ahem, me) doesn't really know anything about the construct they are talking about, and didn't put much care into constructing the items!  \n\n`r qend()`\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nThere are three main proposed adjustments from our initial model:  \n\n1. `item_1 ~~ item_3`. These questions are both about animals. It would make sense that these are related over and above the underlying \"emotional internet usage\" factor. \n2. `item_7 ~~ item_8`. These are both about viewing negative content online, so it makes sense here that they would be related beyond the 'emotional' factor. \n\n3. `emot =~ item_10`. This item is about communicating with others. It currently loads highly on the `pract` factor too. It maybe makes sense here that \"communicating with others\" will capture both a practical element of internet useage _and_ an emotional one. \n\n\nPutting them all in at once could be a mistake - if we added in `emot =~ item_10`, then we change slightly the underlying construct of the `emot` factor, meaning it might make other suggested modifications (`item_7 ~~ item_8`) less important. It's a bit like [Whac-A-Mole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whac-A-Mole){target=\"_blank\"} - you make one modification and then a whole new area of misfits appears!  \n\nLet's adjust our model:  \n```{r}\nmoddoom2 <- \"\n# emotional domain\nemot =~ item_1 + item_2 + item_3 + item_4 + item_5 + item_6 + item_7 + item_8 + item_9 + item_10\n# practical domain\npract =~ item_10 + item_11 + item_13 + item_14 + item_15\n# correlated domains (will be estimated by default)\nemot ~~ pract\n\"\n```\nThen fit it to the data:  \n```{r}\nmoddoom2.est <- cfa(moddoom2, data = doom)\n\nfitmeasures(moddoom2.est)[c(\"rmsea\",\"srmr\",\"cfi\",\"tli\")]\n```\n\nThe fit is still not great, and the same suggested correlations are present in modification indices:  \n```{r}\nmodindices(moddoom2.est, sort=TRUE) |>\n  head()\n```\n\nLet's go ahead and put the covariance between `item_1` and `item_3` in. I personally went for this first because they seem more similar to me than `item_7` and `item_8` do. \n\n```{r}\nmoddoom3 <- \"\n# emotional domain\nemot =~ item_1 + item_2 + item_3 + item_4 + item_5 + item_6 + item_7 + item_8 + item_9 + item_10\n# practical domain\npract =~ item_10 + item_11 + item_13 + item_14 + item_15\n# correlated domains (will be estimated by default)\nemot ~~ pract\nitem_1 ~~ item_3\n\"\n\nmoddoom3.est <- cfa(moddoom3, data = doom)\n\nfitmeasures(moddoom3.est)[c(\"rmsea\",\"srmr\",\"cfi\",\"tli\")]\n```\n\nWhoop! It fits well! It may well be that if we inspect modification indices again, we still see that `item_1 ~~ item_3` would improve our model fit. The thing to remember however, is that we could simply keep adding parameters until we run out of degrees of freedom, and our model would \"fit better\". But such a model would not be useful. It would not generalise well, becaue it runs the risk of being overfitted to the nuances of this specific sample.\n\n`r solend()`\n<br>\n\n# Optional Extra Exercises for the Enthusiastic\n\n:::frame\n__Dataset: radakovic_das.csv__  \n\nApathy is lack of motivation towards goal-directed behaviours. It is pervasive in a majority of psychiatric and neurological diseases, and impacts everyday life. Traditionally, apathy has been measured as a one-dimensional construct but is in fact composed of different types of demotivation.\n\nDimensional Apathy Scale (DAS)\nThe Dimensional Apathy Scale (DAS) is a multidimensional assessment for demotivation, in which 3 subtypes of apathy are assessed:  \n\n- **Executive:** lack of motivation for planning, attention or organisation\n- **Emotional:** lack of emotional motivation (indifference, affective or emotional neutrality, flatness or blunting)\n- **Initiation:** lack of motivation for self-generation of thoughts and/or actions\n\nThe DAS measures these subtypes of apathy and allows for quick and easy assessment, through self-assessment, observations by informants/carers or administration by researchers or healthcare professionals.  \n\nYou can find data for the DAS when administered to 250 healthy adults at [https://uoepsy.github.io/radakovic_das.R](https://uoepsy.github.io/radakovic_das.R){target=\"_blank\"}, and information on the items is below.  \n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n#### DAS Dictionary\n\nAll items are measured on a 6-point Likert scale of Always (0), Almost Always (1), Often (2), Occasionally (3), Hardly Ever (4), and Never (5).

By representing a theoretical model as paths to and from different variables, we open up a whole new way of thinking about how we model the world around us. These _\"path diagrams\"_ have different shapes and symbols to denote the covariances, regressions, observed variables and latent variables.  \n\n- **Observed variables** are represented by squares or rectangles. These are the named variables of interest which exist in our dataset - i.e. the ones which we have measured directly. \n- **Latent variables** are represented as ovals/ellipses or circles.

In many diagrams these are curved.  \n- **Regressions** are shown by single headed arrows (e.g., an arrow from $x$ to $y$ for the path $y \\sim x$). **Factor loadings** are also regression paths - specifying a factor structure is simply to say that some measured variables $y_1\\,,\\, ...\\, ,\\, y_k$ are each regressed onto some unmeasured factor(s).

Often used in construction of questionnaires, scale development, and in the initial stages of developing theoretical frameworks.  \n\n__As a diagram__  \nExploratory Factor Analysis as a diagram has arrows going from the factors to the observed variables. Unlike PCA, we also have 'uniqueness' factors for each variable, representing the various stray causes that are specific to each variable. Sometimes, these uniqueness are represented by an arrow only, but they are technically themselves latent variables, and so can be drawn as circles. \n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: \"100%\"\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/diag_efa1.png\")\n```\n\nWhen we apply a rotation to an EFA, we make it so that some loadings are smaller and some are higher - essentially creating a 'simple structure' (where each variable loads strongly on only one factor and weakly on all other factors). This structure simplifies the interpretation of factors, making them more distinct and easily understandable. With oblique rotations, we also allow factors to be correlated, as indicated by the double headed arrow between them in the diagram below\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: \"100%\"\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/diag_efa2.png\")\n```\n\n:::\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n#### CFA as a diagram\n\n__Used for:__  \nCFA is a method that allows us to assess the validity of a hypothesized factor structure (or to compare competing hypothesized structures).

Instead of including the model formula *inside* the fit function (e.g., `lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = df)`), we tend to do it in a step-by-step process. This is because as our models become more complex, our formulas can pretty long!   \n\nIn lavaan, it is typical to write the model as a character string (e.g. `model <- \"y ~ x1 + x2\"`) and then we pass that formula along with the data to the relevant __lavaan__ function such as `cfa()` or `sem()`, giving it the formula and the data: `cfa(model, data = mydata)`.  \n\n1.

However, the exact meaning of the phrase is different for different modelling frameworks.\n\nWe can think more generally as \"model fit\" as asking \"how well does our model reproduce the characteristics of the data that we observed?\". In things like multiple regression, this has been tied to the question of \"how much variance can we explain in outcome $y$ with our set of predictors?\"^[or in logistic regression, \"what is the likelihood of observing the outcome $y$ given our model parameters?\"].  \n\nFor methods like CFA, path analysis and SEM, we are working with models that run on covariances matrices, so \"model fit\" becomes \"how well can our model reproduce our observed covariance matrix?\".   \n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Degrees of Freedom\n\nIn regression, we could only talk about model fit if we had more than 2 datapoints. This is because there is only one possible line that we can fit between 2 datapoints, and this line explains _all_ of the variance in the outcome variable (it uses up all our 2 degrees of freedom to estimate 1) the intercept and 2) the slope).   \n\nThe logic is the same for model fit in terms of CFA and SEM - we need more degrees of freedom than we have parameters that are estimated. \n\nThe difference is that it is all in terms of our covariance matrix, rather than individual observations. The idea is that we need to be estimating fewer paths (e.g. parameters) than there are variances/covariances in our covariance matrix. This is because if we just fit paths between all our variables, then our model would be able to reproduce the data perfectly (just like a regression with 2 datapoints has an $R^2$ of 1).  \n\n\nThe degrees of freedom for methods like CFA, Path and SEM, that are fitted to the covariance matrix of our data, correspond to the number of *knowns* (observed covariances/variances from our sample) minus the number of *unknowns* (parameters to be estimated by the model). \n\n- **degrees of freedom = number of knowns - number of unknowns**  \n  - number of knowns: how many variances/covariances in our data?  \n  The number of knowns in a covariance matrix of $k$ observed variables is equal to $\\frac{k \\cdot (k+1)}{2}$.  \n  - number of unknowns: how many parameters is our model estimating?  \n  We can reduce the number of unknowns (thereby getting back a degree of freedom) by fixing parameters to be specific values. *By removing a path altogether, we are fixing it to be zero.*  \n\nA model is only able to be estimated if it has at least 0 degrees of freedom (if there are as many knowns as unknowns). A model with 0 degrees of freedom is termed **just-identified**. An **under-identified** model is one with $<0$ degrees of freedom, and an **over-identified** one has $>0$ degrees of freedom.  \n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Fit Indices\n\nThere are _loads_ of different metrics that people use to examine model fit for CFA and SEM, and there's lots of debate over the various merits and disadvantages as well as the proposed cut-offs to be used with each method.  \n\nThe most fundamental test of model fit is a $\\chi^2$ test, which reflects the discrepancy between our observed covariance matrix and the *model-implied* covariance matrix. If we denote the population covariance matrix as $\\Sigma$ and the model-implied covariance matrix as $\\Sigma(\\Theta)$, then we can think of the null hypothesis here as $H_0: \\Sigma - \\Sigma(\\Theta) = 0$. In this way our null hypothesis is that our theoretical model is correct (and can therefore perfectly reproduce the covariance matrix), therefore a significant result indicates _poor_ fit. It is very sensitive to departures from normality, as well as sample size (for models with $n>400$, the $\\chi^2$ is almost always significant), and can often lead to rejecting otherwise adequate models.  \n\nAlongside this, the main four fit indices that are commonly used are known as RMSEA, SRMR, CFI and TLI. Smaller values of RMSEA and SRMR mean better fit while larger values of CFI and TLI mean better fit.  \n\n**Convention:** if $\\textrm{RMSEA} < .05$, $\\textrm{SRMR} < .05$, $\\textrm{TLI} > .95$ and $\\textrm{CFI} > .95$ then the model fits well.  \n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n#### optional: absolute fit indices\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: \"100%\"\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/fitmeas_abs.PNG\")\n```\n\n:::\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n#### optional: incremental fit indices\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: \"100%\"\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/fitmeas_inc.PNG\")\n```\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n\n`r qend()`\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nOur model fits well by all metrics!  \n```{r}\nfitmeasures(cpmod.est)[c(\"srmr\",\"rmsea\",\"cfi\",\"tli\")]\n```\n\n\n`r solend()`\n\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`\nTake a look at the loadings of our variables on to the latent factors (these are in the `estimate` column under \"Latent Variables\" in the `summary()`).  \n\nIn EFA, our factor loadings were always <1, because they were _standardised_ loadings (where the factor and item were both standardised to have a variance of 1). Because a latent variable is unobserved, it's actually up to us how we define its scale! \nIn CFA, the default is to make it have the same scale as its first item, which is why the first loading for each factor is exactly 1, and has no standard error associated with it - it's _fixed_, rather than estimated.  \n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Latent Variable Scaling\n\nin @fig-df1, we can see a the model of a latent factor loading on to 4 items. The number of paths to be estimated here is greater than the number of known covariances. However, we can get around this by *fixing certain parameters to be specific values*. In @fig-df2, the latent factor variance is set at 1, and the residual factor loadings are also set to 1.  \nThis has the additional benefit of making our latent factor have some defining features. Because we don't actually measure the latent variable (it is a hypothetical construct), it doesn't really have any intrinsic 'scale'. When we fix the variance to be 1, we are providing some property (its variance) we create a reference from which the other paths to/from the variable are in relation to.

Each item is measured on a 7-point likert scale from \"strongly disagree\" to \"strongly agree\".  \n\nWe administered this scale to 476 participants in order to assess the validity of the 2 domain structure of the online obsession measure that we obtained during scale development.  \n\nThe data are available at [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/doom.csv](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/doom.csv){target=\"_blank\"}, and the table below shows the individual item wordings.  \n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\ndoom <- read_csv(\"../../data/doom.csv\")\ntibble(\n  variable = names(doom),\n  question = c(\"i just can't stop watching videos of animals\",\n\"i spend hours scrolling through tutorials but never actually attempt any projects.\",\n\"cats are my main source of entertainment.\",\n\"life without the internet would be boring, empty, and joyless\",\n\"i try to hide how long i’ve been online\",\n\"i avoid thinking about things by scrolling on the internet\",\n\"everything i see online is either sad or terrifying\",\n\"all the negative stuff online makes me feel better about my own life\",\n\"i feel better the more 'likes' i receive\",\n\"most of my time online is spent communicating with others\",\n\"my work suffers because of the amount of time i spend online\",\n\"i spend a lot of time online for work\",\n\"i check my emails very regularly\",\n\"others in my life complain about the amount of time i spend online\",\n\"i neglect household chores to spend more time online\")\n) |> gt::gt()\n```\n\n:::\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`\nAssess whether the 2 domain model of online obsession provides a good fit to the validation sample of 476 participants.   \n`r qend()`\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nFrom the visual of the correlation matrix, you can see the vague outline of two groups of items correlations.

Note that this would still be in a sense _exploratory,_ and we should be very clear when writing up about the process that we undertook. We should also avoid just shoving any parameter in that might make it fit better - we should let common sense and theoretical knowledge support any adjustments we make.  \n\nThe `modindices()` function takes a fitted model object from __lavaan__ and provides a table of all the possible additional parameters we _could_ estimate.  \n\nThe output is a table, which we can ask to be sorted according to the `mi` column using `sort = TRUE`.  \n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nmodindices(myfittedmodel, sort = TRUE)\n```\n```\n      lhs op    rhs     mi    epc sepc.lv sepc.all sepc.nox\n72  item6 ~~ item10 10.747  0.082   0.082    0.144    0.144\n25 fact1  =~  item7  8.106  0.119   0.080    0.080    0.080\n65  item5 ~~  item7  6.720  0.039   0.039    0.160    0.160\n71  item6 ~~  item9  6.675 -0.065  -0.065   -0.115   -0.115\n.   ...   .   ...    ...    ...     ...      ...      ...\n```\n\nThe columns show:  \n\n| `lhs`,`op`,`rhs`  | `mi`  | `epc` | `sepc.lv`, `sepc.all`,`sepc.nox`    |\n| --------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |\n| these three columns show the specific parameter, in lavaan syntax. So `fact1 =~ item7` is for the possible inclusion of `item7` being loaded on to the latent variable `fact1`. `item6 ~~ item10` is for the inclusion of a covariance between `item6` and `item10`, and so on. | \"modification index\" = the change in the model $\\chi^2$ value _were we to include this parameter in the model_ | \"expected parameter change\" = the estimated value that the parameter _would take were it included in the model_ | these provide the `epc` values but scaled to when a) the latent variables are standardised, b) all variables are standardised, and c) all except exogenous observed variables are standardised (not relevant for CFA) |\n\n\nOften, the `sepc.all`is a useful column to look at, because it shows the proposed parameter estimate in a standardised metric. i.e. if the `op` is `~~`, then the `sepc.all` value is a correlation, and so we can consider anything <.2/.3ish to be quite small. If `op` is `=~`, then the `sepc.all` value is a standardised factor loading, so values >.3 or >.4 are worth thinking about, and so on. \n:::\n\n\n`r qend()`\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nI'm printing out just the `head()`, so that I can look at the few parameters with the greatest modification indices.  \nThe top three parameters jump out immediately to me.  \n`item_1` and `item_3` have a suggested correlation of c0.5, as do `item_7` and `item_8`. In addition, it's suggested that including a loading (estimated to be about 0.6) from `item_10` to the `emot` factor would improve the model fit.\n```{r}\nmodindices(moddoom.est, sort=TRUE) |>\n  head()\n```\n\n`r solend()`\n\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`\n__Beware:__ there's a slightly blurred line here that we're about to step over, and move from confirmatory back to 'exploratory'.  \n\nLook carefully at the item wordings,do any of the suggested modifications make theoretical sense?

Does this new model fit well?  \n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n#### model modifications are exploratory!!\n\nIt's likely you will have to make a couple of modifications in order to obtain a model that fits well to this data.  \n\n__BUT...__ we could simply keep adding suggested parameters to our model and we will eventually end up with a perfectly fitting model.  \n\nIt's very important to think critically here about _why_ such modifications may be necessary. \n\n- The initial model may have failed to capture the complexity of the underlying relationships among variables. For instance, suggested residual covariances, representing unexplained covariation among observed variables, may indicate misspecification in the initial model. \n- The structure of the construct is genuinely different in your population from the initial one in which the scale is developed (this could be a research question in and of itself - i.e. does the structure of \"anxiety\" differ as people age, or differ between cultures?)\n\nModifications to a CFA model should be made judiciously, with careful consideration of theory as well as quantitative metrics. The goal is to develop a model that accurately represents the underlying structure of the data while maintaining theoretical coherence and generalizability.  \n\n:::\n\nIn this case, the likely reason for the poor fit of the \"DOOM\" scale, is that the person who made the items (ahem, me) doesn't really know anything about the construct they are talking about, and didn't put much care into constructing the items!  \n\n`r qend()`\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nThere are three main proposed adjustments from our initial model:  \n\n1. `item_1 ~~ item_3`. These questions are both about animals. It would make sense that these are related over and above the underlying \"emotional internet usage\" factor. \n2. `item_7 ~~ item_8`. These are both about viewing negative content online, so it makes sense here that they would be related beyond the 'emotional' factor. \n\n3. `emot =~ item_10`. This item is about communicating with others. It currently loads highly on the `pract` factor too. It maybe makes sense here that \"communicating with others\" will capture both a practical element of internet useage _and_ an emotional one. \n\n\nPutting them all in at once could be a mistake - if we added in `emot =~ item_10`, then we change slightly the underlying construct of the `emot` factor, meaning it might make other suggested modifications (`item_7 ~~ item_8`) less important. It's a bit like [Whac-A-Mole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whac-A-Mole){target=\"_blank\"} - you make one modification and then a whole new area of misfits appears!  \n\nLet's adjust our model:  \n```{r}\nmoddoom2 <- \"\n# emotional domain\nemot =~ item_1 + item_2 + item_3 + item_4 + item_5 + item_6 + item_7 + item_8 + item_9 + item_10\n# practical domain\npract =~ item_10 + item_11 + item_13 + item_14 + item_15\n# correlated domains (will be estimated by default)\nemot ~~ pract\n\"\n```\nThen fit it to the data:  \n```{r}\nmoddoom2.est <- cfa(moddoom2, data = doom)\n\nfitmeasures(moddoom2.est)[c(\"rmsea\",\"srmr\",\"cfi\",\"tli\")]\n```\n\nThe fit is still not great, and the same suggested correlations are present in modification indices:  \n```{r}\nmodindices(moddoom2.est, sort=TRUE) |>\n  head()\n```\n\nLet's go ahead and put the covariance between `item_1` and `item_3` in. I personally went for this first because they seem more similar to me than `item_7` and `item_8` do. \n\n```{r}\nmoddoom3 <- \"\n# emotional domain\nemot =~ item_1 + item_2 + item_3 + item_4 + item_5 + item_6 + item_7 + item_8 + item_9 + item_10\n# practical domain\npract =~ item_10 + item_11 + item_13 + item_14 + item_15\n# correlated domains (will be estimated by default)\nemot ~~ pract\nitem_1 ~~ item_3\n\"\n\nmoddoom3.est <- cfa(moddoom3, data = doom)\n\nfitmeasures(moddoom3.est)[c(\"rmsea\",\"srmr\",\"cfi\",\"tli\")]\n```\n\nWhoop! It fits well! It may well be that if we inspect modification indices again, we still see that `item_1 ~~ item_3` would improve our model fit. The thing to remember however, is that we could simply keep adding parameters until we run out of degrees of freedom, and our model would \"fit better\". But such a model would not be useful. It would not generalise well, becaue it runs the risk of being overfitted to the nuances of this specific sample.\n\n`r solend()`\n<br>\n\n# Optional Extra Exercises for the Enthusiastic\n\n:::frame\n__Dataset: radakovic_das.csv__  \n\nApathy is lack of motivation towards goal-directed behaviours. It is pervasive in a majority of psychiatric and neurological diseases, and impacts everyday life. Traditionally, apathy has been measured as a one-dimensional construct but is in fact composed of different types of demotivation.\n\nDimensional Apathy Scale (DAS)\nThe Dimensional Apathy Scale (DAS) is a multidimensional assessment for demotivation, in which 3 subtypes of apathy are assessed:  \n\n- **Executive:** lack of motivation for planning, attention or organisation\n- **Emotional:** lack of emotional motivation (indifference, affective or emotional neutrality, flatness or blunting)\n- **Initiation:** lack of motivation for self-generation of thoughts and/or actions\n\nThe DAS measures these subtypes of apathy and allows for quick and easy assessment, through self-assessment, observations by informants/carers or administration by researchers or healthcare professionals.  \n\nYou can find data for the DAS when administered to 250 healthy adults at [https://uoepsy.github.io/radakovic_das.R](https://uoepsy.github.io/radakovic_das.R){target=\"_blank\"}, and information on the items is below.  \n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n#### DAS Dictionary\n\nAll items are measured on a 6-point Likert scale of Always (0), Almost Always (1), Often (2), Occasionally (3), Hardly Ever (4), and Never (5).

Just in question 1 for now:  \n```{r}\nunique(rdas$q1)\n```\n\nA little trick that we can use to find the unique values in an entire dataset is to quickly convert the dataframe into one big long vector. Technically, a dataframe is a \"list of vectors\", and the function `unlist()` will remove this structure.  \nSo we can find all the unique values in all the questions with:  \n```{r}\nunique(unlist(rdas))\n```\n\nPerfect. So we know we have uniformity of spelling. It happens less often these days as questionnaire software is improving, but you might occasionally encounter typos in _some_ of the questions, or things with and without capital letters (R is a bit thick, and doesn't recognise that \"Often\" and \"often\" are the same thing).  \nNote that we have the 6 responses that we would expect given the description of the scale, but we also have some `NA` values, and some `[NO ENTRY]` values.
