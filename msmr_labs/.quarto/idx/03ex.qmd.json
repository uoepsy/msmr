Performance on all of tasks was calculated as a percentage of total possible score, thereby ranging from 0 to 100. \n\nWe're interested in *whether performance on these tasks differed at the outset of the study, and if they differed in their subsequent change in performance*.  \n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\ntibble(\n    variable = names(Az),\n    description = c(\"Unique Subject Identifier\",\"Time point of the study (1 to 10)\",\"Task type (Memory, cADL, sADL)\",\"Score on test (range 0 to 100)\")\n) |> gt::gt()\n```\n:::\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`\nLoad in the data and examine it.  \nHow many participants, how many observations per participant, per task?  \n`r qend()`\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n```{r}\nload(url(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/Az.rda\"))\nsummary(Az)\n```\n\n30 participants: \n```{r}\nlength(unique(Az$Subject))\n```\n\nDoes every participant have 10 datapoints for each Task type?

Because this way you can get a shape of the average trajectories of performance over time in each task.  \n\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Hints\n\nFor an example plot, see [3A #example-in-mlm](03a_poly.html#example-in-mlm){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n:::\n\n\n`r qend()` \n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\nYou can use \"pointranges\", or \"line\" and \"ribbon\".  \n`stat_summary` will take the data and for each value of `x` calculate some function (in this case the mean, or the mean and SE):  \n```{r}\nggplot(Az, aes(Time, Performance, color=Task, fill=Task)) + \n  stat_summary(fun.data=mean_se, geom=\"ribbon\", color=NA, alpha=0.5) +\n  stat_summary(fun=mean, geom=\"line\")\n```\n`r solend()`\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`\nWhy do you think *raw/natural* polynomials might be more useful than *orthogonal* polynomials for these data?  \n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Hints\n\nAre we somewhat interested in group differences (i.e. differences in scores, or differences in rate of change) at *a specific point* in time?  \n\n:::\n\n\n`r qend()` \n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\nBecause we're interested in whether there are task differences at the starting point, raw polynomials are probably what we want here.  \n`r solend()`\n\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`\nRe-center the Time variable so that the intercept is the first timepoint.  \n  \nThen choose an appropriate degree of polynomial (if any), and fit a full model that allows us to address the research aims.  \n\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Hints\n\nNote there is no part of the research question that specifically asks about how \"gradual\" or \"quick\" the change is (which would suggest we are interested in the quadratic term).  \n\nHowever, the plot can help to give us a sense of what degree of polynomial terms might be suitable to succinctly describe the trends.  \n\nIn many cases, fitting higher and higher order polynomials will likely result in a 'better fit' to our sample data, but these will be worse and worse at generalising to new data - i.e. we run the risk of *overfitting*.  \n\n:::\n\n`r qend()`\n`r solbegin(label=\"1 - how many polynomials?\", slabel=F,show=T, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nIn our plot, there were 2 straight line and one slightly curvy one.

E.g., Some participants might be much better at the memory task than other tasks, some might be better at the other tasks.  \n__Q:__ Could participants vary in how tasks differ in their performance over time?  \n__A:__ Yes, `((poly1 + poly2)*Task | Subject)`.

In doing so, it achieves more or less the same thing, but by capturing these as intercept variances between levels of `x`, we don't have to worry about lots of covariances:  \n\n\n:::: {.columns}\n:::{.column width=\"45%\"}\n`(1 + x | g)`  \n\n```\nGroups   Name        Std.Dev.

This is going to feel confusing, but don't worry, we'll see more structures like this next week.**    \n\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Hints\n\n`... + (1 + poly1 + poly2 | Subject) + (1 + poly1 + poly2 | Subject:Task)`  \n\nTo then start simplifying (if this model doesn't converge), it can be helpful to look at the `VarCorr()` of the non-converging model to see if anything looks awry. Look for small variances, perfect (or near perfect) correlations. These might be sensible things to remove.  \n\n:::\n\n`r qend()`\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\nHere's our model with subject-task effects on the right hand side.  \nAgain we have problems, as we have a singular fit:  \n```{r}\nm2 = lmer(Performance ~ (poly1 + poly2) * Task +\n            (1 + poly1 + poly2 | Subject) +\n            (1 + poly1 + poly2 | Subject:Task),\n          data=Az, control=lmerControl(optimizer = \"bobyqa\"))\n```\n<p style=\"color:red;font-size:.8em\">boundary (singular) fit: see help('isSingular')</p>\n\nLooking at the random effects of our model, note that the `poly2|Subject` random effect has very little variance (and high correlations).  \nNote that it makes sense that by including the random effects for `Subject:Task`, there might not be much above that leftover in `Subject` random effects. \n```{r}\nVarCorr(m2)\n```\n\n\nWhen we remove it, our model converges!!  \n```{r}\nm3 = lmer(Performance ~ (poly1 + poly2) * Task +\n            (1 + poly1 | Subject) +\n            (1 + poly1 + poly2 | Subject:Task),\n          data=Az, control=lmerControl(optimizer = \"bobyqa\"))\n```\n\n`r solend()`\n\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`\n\nConduct a series of model comparisons investigating whether \n\n1.
