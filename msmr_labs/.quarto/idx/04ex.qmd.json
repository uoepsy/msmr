All patients had monthly therapy sessions. Generalised Anxiety Disorder was assessed at baseline and then every visit over 4 months of sessions (5 assessments in total).  \n\nThe data are available at [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/msmr_gadeduc.csv](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/msmr_gadeduc.csv){target=\"_blank\"}\n\nYou can find a data dictionary below:\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| label: tbl-msmr_gadeduc.csv\n#| tbl-cap: \"Data Dictionary: msmr_gadeduc.csv\"\ntibble(\n    variable = names(geduc),\n    description = c(\"A patient code in which the labels take the form <Therapist initials>_<group>_<patient number>.\",\"Score on the GAD7 at baseline\", \n                    \"GAD7 at 1 month assessment\",\n                    \"GAD7 at 2 month assessment\",\n                    \"GAD7 at 3 month assessment\",\n                    \"GAD7 at 4 month assessment\"\n                    )\n)  |>\n    kableExtra::kbl() |>\n    kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)\n```\n\n:::\n\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`\nUh-oh... these data aren't in the same shape as the other datasets we've been giving you..  \n\nCan you get it into a format that is ready for modelling?  \n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Hints\n\n- It's wide, and we want it long.  \n- Once it's long. \"visit_0\", \"visit_1\",.. needs to become the numbers 0, 1, ...\n- One variable (`patient`) contains lots of information that we want to separate out. There's a handy function in the __tidyverse__ called `separate()`, check out the help docs!  \n\n:::\n\n\n`r qend()`\n`r solbegin(label=\"1 - reshaping\", slabel=F,show=T, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\nHere's the data. We have one row per patient, but we have multiple observations for each patient across the columns..  \n```{r}\ngeduc = read_csv(\"../../data/msmr_gadeduc.csv\")\nhead(geduc)\n```\n\nWe can make it long by taking the all the columns from `visit_0` to `visit_4` and shoving their values into one variable, and keeping the name of the column they come from as another variable:  \n```{r}\ngeduc |> \n  pivot_longer(2:last_col(), names_to=\"visit\",values_to=\"GAD\")\n```\n\n\n`r solend()`\n`r solbegin(label=\"2 - time is numeric\", slabel=F,show=T, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\nNow we know how to get our data long, we need to sort out our time variable (`visit`) and make it into numbers.  \nWe can replace all occurrences of the string `\"visit_\"` with nothingness `\"\"`, and then convert them to numeric.  \n\n```{r}\ngeduc |> \n  pivot_longer(2:last_col(), names_to=\"visit\",values_to=\"GAD\") |>\n  mutate(\n    visit = as.numeric(gsub(\"visit_\",\"\",visit))\n  ) \n```\n\n\n`r solend()`\n`r solbegin(label=\"3 - splitting up the patient variable\", slabel=F,show=T, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\nFinally, we need to sort out the `patient` variable. It contains 3 bits of information that we will want to have separated out. It has the therapist (their initials), then the group (treatment or control), and then the patient number. These are all separated by an underscore \"_\".  \n\nThe `separate()` function takes a column and separates it into several things (as many things as we give it), splitting them by some user defined separator such as an underscore:  \n```{r}\ngeduc_long <- geduc |> \n  pivot_longer(2:last_col(), names_to=\"visit\",values_to=\"GAD\") |>\n  mutate(\n    visit = as.numeric(gsub(\"visit_\",\"\",visit))\n  ) |>\n  separate(patient, into=c(\"therapist\",\"group\",\"patient\"), sep=\"_\")\n```\n\nAnd we're ready to go!  \n```{r}\ngeduc_long\n```\n\n`r solend()`\n\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`\nVisualise the data. Does it look like the treatment had an effect?  \nDoes it look like it worked for every therapist?  \n\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Hints\n\n- remember, `stat_summary()` is very useful for aggregating data inside a plot.  \n\n:::\n\n\n`r qend()`\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\nHere's the overall picture. The average score on the GAD7 at each visit gets more and more different between the two groups. The treatment looks effective.. \n```{r}\nggplot(geduc_long, aes(x = visit, y = GAD, col = group)) +\n  stat_summary(geom=\"pointrange\")\n```\n\nLet's split this up by therapist, so we can see the averages across each therapist's set of patients.  \nThere's clear variability between therapists in how well the treatment worked. For instance, the therapists `PT` and `GI` don't seem to have much difference between their groups of patients.\n```{r}\n#| out-width: \"100%\"\nggplot(geduc_long, aes(x = visit, y = GAD, col = group)) +\n  stat_summary(geom=\"pointrange\") +\n  facet_wrap(~therapist)\n```\n\n`r solend()`\n\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`\nFit a model to test if the psychoeducational treatment is associated with greater improvement in anxiety over time.  \n`r qend()`\n`r solbegin(label=\"1 - fixed effects\", slabel=F,show=T, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nWe want to know if how anxiety (`GAD`) changes over time (`visit`) is different between treatment and control (`group`).  \n\nHopefully this should hopefully come as no surprise^[if it does, head back to where we learned about interactions in the single level regressions `lm()`. It's just the same here.] - it's an interaction!  \n\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nlmer(GAD ~ visit * group + ...\n       ...\n     data = geduc_long)\n```\n\n`r solend()`\n`r solbegin(label=\"2 - grouping structure\", slabel=F,show=T, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nWe have multiple observations for each of the `r sum(tn$np)` patients, and those patients are nested within `r nrow(tn)` therapists.  \n\nNote that in our data, the patient variable does not uniquely specify the individual patients. i.e. patient \"1\" from therapist \"OT\" is a different person from patient \"1\" from therapist \"ND\". To correctly group the observations into different patients (and not 'patient numbers'), we need to have `therapist:patient`.  \n\nSo we capture therapist-level differences in `( ... | therapist)` and the patients-within-therapist-level differences in `( ... | therapist:patient)`:  \n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nlmer(GAD ~ visit * group + ...\n       ( ... | therapist) + \n       ( ... | therapist:patient),\n     data = geduc_long)\n```\n\n\n`r solend()`\n`r solbegin(label=\"3 - random effects\", slabel=F,show=T, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nNote that each patient can change differently in their anxiety levels over time - i.e. the slope of `visit` could vary by participant.  \n\nLikewise, some therapists could have patients who change differently from patients from another therapist, so `visit|therapist` can be included.  \n\nEach patient is in one of the two groups - they're _either_ treatment _or_ control. So we can't say that \"differences in anxiety due to treatment varies between patients\", because for any one patient the \"difference in anxiety due to treatment\" is not defined in our study design.  \n\nHowever, therapists see multiple different patients, some of which are in the treatment group, and some of which are in the control group. So the treatment effect _could_ be different for different therapists!  \n\n```{r}\nmod1 <- lmer(GAD ~ visit*group + \n               (1+visit*group|therapist)+\n               (1+visit|therapist:patient),\n             geduc_long)\n```\n\n`r solend()`\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`\nFor each of the models below, what is wrong with the random effect structure?  \n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nmodelA <- lmer(GAD ~ visit*group + \n               (1+visit*group|therapist)+\n               (1+visit|patient),\n             geduc_long)\n```\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nmodelB <- lmer(GAD ~ visit*group + \n               (1+visit*group|therapist/patient),\n             geduc_long)\n```\n\n\n`r qend()`\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nmodelA <- lmer(GAD ~ visit*group + \n               (1+visit*group|therapist)+\n               (1+visit|patient),\n             geduc_long)\n```\n\nThe `patient` variable doesn't capture the different patients _within_ therapists, so this actually fits crossed random effects and treats all data where `patient==1` as from the same group (even if this includes several different patients' worth of data from different therapists!)\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nmodelB <- lmer(GAD ~ visit*group + \n               (1+visit*group|therapist/patient),\n             geduc_long)\n```\n\nUsing the `/` here means we have the same random slopes fitted for therapists and for patients-within-therapists. but the effect of group can't vary by patient, so this doesn't work. hence why we need to split them up into `(...|therapist)+(...|therapist:patient)`.  \n\n`r solend()`\n\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`\nLet's suppose that I don't want the psychoeducation treatment, I just want the standard therapy sessions that the 'Control' group received.

One group studied the material twice (`StudyStudy`), the other group studied the material once then did a test (`StudyTest`). Recall was tested immediately (one minute) after the learning session and one week later. The recall tests were composed of 175 items identified by a keyword (`Test_word`). \n\nThe critical (replication) prediction is that the `StudyStudy` group recall more items on the immediate test, but the `StudyTest` group will retain the material better and thus perform better on the 1-week follow-up test.  \n\nThe following code loads the data into your R environment by creating a variable called `tel`:\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nload(url(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/testenhancedlearning.RData\"))\n```\n\n```{r} \n#| echo: false\n#| label: tbl-teldict\n#| tbl-cap: \"Data Dictionary: testenhancedlearning.Rdata\"\nload(url(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/testenhancedlearning.RData\"))\ntibble(\n  variable=names(tel),\n  description=c(\"Unique Participant Identifier\", \"Group denoting whether the participant studied the material twice (StudyStudy), or studied it once then did a test (StudyTest)\",\"Time of recall test ('min' = Immediate, 'week' = One week later)\",\"Word being recalled (175 different test words)\",\"Whether or not the word was correctly recalled\",\"Time to recall word (milliseconds)\")\n) |>\n    kableExtra::kbl() |>\n    kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)\n```\n\n:::\n\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`\nLoad and plot the data.

The most obvious option is to take successful learning as \"correctly recalling\" an item. This means we take the `Correct` variable as our outcome.  \n\nNote we also have `Rtime` - the \"time-to-recall\" of an item. This could also work as an outcome, but note that it also includes the time it took participants to provide an incorrect response too. If this was your own project, you may well want to provide analyses of `Correct`, and then also of the time-taken, but on the subset of correcty recalled items.  \n\n:::\n\n\n`r qend()`\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\n```{r}\nload(url(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/testenhancedlearning.RData\"))\n\nggplot(tel, aes(Delay, Correct, col=Group)) + \n  stat_summary(fun.data=mean_se, geom=\"pointrange\")+\n  theme_light()\n```\n\nThat looks like test-enhanced learning to me!  \n\n\n`r solend()`\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`\n\nTest the critical hypothesis using a mixed-effects model.  \n\nFit the maximal random effect structure supported by the experimental design. Simplify the random effect structure until you reach a model that converges.  \n\n__Note:__ Some of the models you attempt here might take time to fit. This is normal, and you can cancel the estimation at any time by pressing the escape key.  \nI suggest that you write your initial model, set it running, and then look at the first solution to see if it converged for me. You can assume that if it didn't work for me, it also won't work for you. I've shown the random effects for each model, in case it helps in deciding your next step.  \n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Hints\n\nWhat we're aiming to do here is to follow [Barr et al.'s](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jml.2012.11.001) advice of defining our maximal model and then removing only the terms to allow a non-singular fit.  \n\n+ What kind of model will you use? What is our outcome? is it binary, or continuous? \n+ We can expect variability across subjects (some people are better at learning than others) and across items (some of the recall items are harder than others). How should this be represented in the random effects?\n\n:::\n\n`r qend()` \n`r solbegin(label=\"1 - maximal model\", slabel=F,show=T, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n# save(mod1,mod2,mod3,mod4,file=\"data/telmodels.Rdata\")\nload(\"data/telmodels.Rdata\")\n```\n\nWe have a __crossed__ random effect structure here. Each participant was tested on every word, and each word was seen by every participant.  \n\nSubjects were tested at both the `min` and `week`, so `Delay|Subject_ID` can be included (some people might retain the items better than others).  \nLikewise the words were seen at both `min` and `week`, and some words might be more easy to retain than others (`Delay|Test_word`).  \n\nThe participants are in either one group or another, so we can't have `Group|Subject_ID`. However, the words were seen by people in both groups, so we _can_ have `Group|Test_word`.  \n\nThis one took my computer about 6 minutes.  \n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nmod1 <- glmer(Correct ~ Delay*Group +\n             (1 + Delay | Subject_ID) +\n             (1 + Delay * Group | Test_word),\n             family=binomial, data=tel)\n```\n<p style=\"color:red;font-size:.8em\">\nWarning message:<br>\nIn checkConv(attr(opt, \"derivs\"), opt\\$par, ctrl = control\\$checkConv,  :<br>\n  Model failed to converge with max|grad| = 0.0184773 (tol = 0.002, component 1)\n</p>\n\n```{r}\nVarCorr(mod1)\n```\n\n`r solend()`\n`r solbegin(label=\"2 - Removing Delay*Group|Test_word\", slabel=F,show=T, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nLets remove the interaction in the by-word random effects.  \nThis one took about 5 minutes...\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nmod2 <- glmer(Correct ~ Delay*Group +\n             (1 + Delay | Subject_ID) +\n             (1 + Delay + Group | Test_word),\n             family=binomial, data=tel)\n```\n<p style=\"color:red;font-size:.8em\">\nWarning message:<br>\nIn checkConv(attr(opt, \"derivs\"), opt\\$par, ctrl = control\\$checkConv,  :<br>\n  Model failed to converge with max|grad| = 0.00887744 (tol = 0.002, component 1)\n</p>\n\n```{r}\nVarCorr(mod2)\n```\n\n`r solend()`\n`r solbegin(label=\"3 - Removing Group|Test_word\", slabel=F,show=T, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nWe still have a singular fit here. Thinking about the study, if we are going to remove __one__ of the by-testword random effects (`Delay` or `Group`), which one do we consider to be more theoretically justified? Is the effect of Delay likely to vary by test-words? More so than the effect of group is likely to vary by test-words?  \nQuite possibly - it's reasonable to think that some words will be more easily retained over a week than others, but I can't come up with a reason to think why `StudyTest` vs `StudyStudy` would have a different effect for some words than others.  \n\nLet's remove the by-testword random effect of group. \n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nmod3 <- glmer(Correct ~ Delay*Group +\n             (1 + Delay | Subject_ID) +\n             (1 + Delay | Test_word),\n             family=binomial, data=tel)\n```\n\nThis one converges! But we still have a correlation of -1.  \nWhy did we not get a warning message?  \n```{r}\nVarCorr(mod3)\n```\n\nThe `isSingular()` function allows us to check for when a model is close to singularity (i.e. on the boundary of the feasible parameter space):  \n```{r}\nisSingular(mod3)\n```\n\nThis suggests that we're fine! However, note that this function has a tolerance, which is by default set to 1e-4, or 0.0001.

The aim of the present study is to investigate differences in the development of vocabulary between monolingual and bilingual children.  \n\nThe data are available at [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/pvt_bilingual.csv](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/pvt_bilingual.csv).  \n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| label: tbl-pvtdict\n#| tbl-cap: \"Data Dictionary: pvt_bilingual.csv\"\ntibble(variable = names(pvt),\n       description = c(\n         \"Child's name\",\n         \"School Identifier\",\n         \"Binary variable indicating whether the child is monolingual (0) or bilingual (1)\",\n         \"Age (years)\",\n         \"Score on the Picture Vocab Test (PVT).

Is that right?  \n```{r}\nn_distinct(pvt$child)\n```\n\nGiven that the `pvt$child` variable is just the first name of the child, it's entirely likely that there will be, for instance more than one \"Martin\".  \n\nThis says that there are 487!  \n```{r}\npvt |> count(school, child) |> nrow()\n```\n\nBut wait... we could _still_ have issues. What if there were 2 \"Martin\"s at the same school??\n```{r}\npvt |> \n  # count the school-children groups\n  count(school, child) |> \n  # arrange the output so that the highest \n  # values of the 'n' column are at the top\n  arrange(desc(n))\n```\n\nAha! There are 7 cases where schools have two children of the same name. Remember that each child was measured at 7 timepoints. We shouldn't have people with 14!  \n\nIf we actually _look_ at the data, we'll see that it is very neatly organised, with each child's data together. This means that we could feasibly make an educated guess that, e.g., the \"Jackson\" from \"School 3\" in rows 155-161 is different from the \"Jackson\" from \"School 3\" at rows 190-196. \n\nBecause of the ordering of our data, we can do something like this:  \n```{r}\npvt <- \n  pvt |>\n  # group by the school and child\n  group_by(school, child) |>\n  mutate(\n    # make a new variable which counts from 1 to \n    # the number of rows for each school-child\n    n_obs = 1:n()\n  ) |>\n  # ungroup the data\n  ungroup() |>\n  mutate(\n    # change it so that if the n_obs is >7, the \n    # child becomes \"[name] 2\", to indicate they're the second\n    # child with that name\n    child = ifelse(n_obs>7, paste0(child,\" 2\"), child)\n  )\n```\n\nNow we have 494!  \n```{r}\npvt |> count(school, child) |> nrow()\n```\n\nAnd nobody has anything other than 7 observations!\n```{r}\npvt |> count(school, child) |>\n  filter(n != 7)\n```\n\nPhew!  \n\nOkay, let's just fit an intercept-only model:  \n```{r}\n# pvt <- read_csv(\"../../data/bntmono.csv\")\npvt_null <- lmer(PVT ~ 1 +  (1 | school/child), data = pvt)\nsummary(pvt_null)\n```\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\nvcres = VarCorr(pvt_null) |> as.data.frame()\nvcres = round(vcres$vcov,2)\n```\n\n\nAs we can see from `summary(bnt_null)`, the random intercept variances are `r vcres[1]` for child-level, `r vcres[2]` for school-level, and the residual variance is `r vcres[3]`.\n\nSo child level differences account for $\\frac{`r vcres[1]`}{`r paste0(vcres,collapse=\" + \")`} = `r round(vcres[1]/sum(vcres),2)`$ of the variance in PVT scores, and child & school differences together account for $\\frac{`r paste0(vcres[1:2],collapse=\" + \")`}{`r paste0(vcres,collapse=\" + \")`} = `r round(sum(vcres[1:2])/sum(vcres),2)`$ of the variance.\n\nHere's an initial plot too:\n\n```{r}\nggplot(pvt, aes(x=age,y=PVT,col=factor(isBilingual)))+\n  stat_summary(geom=\"pointrange\")+\n  stat_summary(geom=\"line\")\n```\n\nI feel like either raw or orthogonal polynomials would be fine here - there's nothing explicit from the study background about stuff \"at baseline\". There's the stuff about the plateau at 7 or 8, but we can get that from the model plots. Orthogonal will allow us to compare the trajectories overall (their linear trend, the 'curviness' and 'wiggliness').  \n\nAn additional benefit of orthogonal polynomials is that we are less likely to get singular fits when we include polynomial terms in our random effects. Remember, raw polynomials are correlated, so often the by-participant variances in raw poly terms are highly correlated. \n\nI've gone for 3 degrees of polynomials here because the plot above shows a bit of an S-shape for the bilinguals. \n\n```{r}\npvt <- pvt |> mutate(\n  poly1 = poly(age, 3)[,1],\n  poly2 = poly(age, 3)[,2],\n  poly3 = poly(age, 3)[,3],\n  isBilingual = factor(isBilingual)\n)\n```\n\nThese models do not converge.  \nI've tried to preserve the by-child random effects of time, because while I think Schools probably _do_ vary, School's all teach the same curriculum, whereas there's _a lot_ of varied things that can influence a child's vocabulary, both in and out of school  \n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nmod1 <- lmer(PVT ~ 1 + (poly1 + poly2 + poly3) * isBilingual + \n       (1 + (poly1 + poly2 + poly3)*isBilingual | school) + \n       (1 + (poly1 + poly2 + poly3) | school:child),\n     data = pvt)\n\nmod2 <- lmer(PVT ~ 1 + (poly1 + poly2 + poly3) * isBilingual + \n       (1 + isBilingual * (poly1 + poly2) + poly3 | school) +\n       (1 + (poly1 + poly2 + poly3) | school:child),\n     data = pvt)\n\nmod3 <- lmer(PVT ~ 1 + (poly1 + poly2 + poly3) * isBilingual + \n       (1 + isBilingual * poly1 + poly2 + poly3 | school) +\n       (1 + (poly1 + poly2 + poly3) | school:child),\n     data = pvt)\n\nmod4 <- lmer(PVT ~ 1 + (poly1 + poly2 + poly3) * isBilingual + \n       (1 + isBilingual + poly1 + poly2 + poly3 | school) +\n       (1 + (poly1 + poly2 + poly3) | school:child),\n     data = pvt)\n\nmod5 <- lmer(PVT ~ 1 + (poly1 + poly2 + poly3) * isBilingual + \n       (1 + isBilingual + poly1 + poly3 | school) +\n       (1 + (poly1 + poly2 + poly3) | school:child),\n     data = pvt)\n# relative to the variance in time slopes, there's v little by-school variance in bilingual differences in vocab\n\nmod6 <- lmer(PVT ~ 1 + (poly1 + poly2 + poly3) * isBilingual + \n       (1 + poly1 + poly2 +  poly3 | school) +\n       (1 + (poly1 + poly2 + poly3) | school:child),\n     data = pvt)\n# looks like curvature doesn't vary between schools much as linear and wiggliness \n```\n\nthis one does! \n```{r}\nmod7 <- lmer(PVT ~ 1 + (poly1 + poly2 + poly3) * isBilingual + \n       (1 + poly1 + poly3 | school) +\n       (1 + (poly1 + poly2 + poly3) | school:child),\n     data = pvt)\n```\n\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(broom.mixed)\naugment(mod7) |> \n  mutate(\n    poly1 = round(poly1, 3) # because of rounding errors that make plot weird\n  ) |>\n  ggplot(aes(x=poly1,col=isBilingual))+\n  stat_summary(geom=\"pointrange\",aes(y=PVT))+\n  stat_summary(geom=\"line\", aes(y=.fitted))\n```\n\nrefitted with lmerTest:  \n```{r}\nmod7 <- lmerTest::lmer(PVT ~ 1 + (poly1 + poly2 + poly3) * isBilingual + \n       (1 + poly1 + poly3 | school) +\n       (1 + (poly1 + poly2 + poly3) | school:child),\n     data = pvt)\n\nsummary(mod7)\n```\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\nmm <- lmerTest::lmer(PVT ~ 1 + (poly1 + poly2 + poly3) * isBilingual + \n       (1 + poly1 + poly3 | school) +\n       (1 + (poly1 + poly2 + poly3) | school:child),\n     data = pvt)\n\ntidy(mm) |> filter(effect==\"fixed\") |> transmute(\n  term,\n  est = round(estimate,2),\n  p = ifelse(p.value<.05,\"*\",\"\"),\n  interpretation = c(\n    \"average vocab score at the mean age (for monolingual)\",\n    \"vocab increases over time (for monolingual children)\",\n    \"the increase in vocab becomes more gradual (for monolingual children)\",\n    \"no significant wiggliness to vocab trajectory of the average monolingual child\",\n    \"average vocab score at mean age is lower for bilingual vs monolingual children\",\n    \"no significant difference in linear trend of vocab for bilingual vs monolingual\",\n    \"curvature for vocab trajectory of bilingual children significantly differs from that of monolinguals\",\n    \"wiggliness for vocab trajectory of bilingual children significantly differs from that of monolinguals\"\n  )\n) |> gt::gt()\n```\n\nFrom the random effects, we get even more information!  \nSchool's vary in the average child vocab score at mean age with an SD of 4.5.

For instance, the therapists `PT` and `GI` don't seem to have much difference between their groups of patients.\n```{r}\n#| out-width: \"100%\"\nggplot(geduc_long, aes(x = visit, y = GAD, col = group)) +\n  stat_summary(geom=\"pointrange\") +\n  facet_wrap(~therapist)\n```\n\n`r solend()`\n\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`\nFit a model to test if the psychoeducational treatment is associated with greater improvement in anxiety over time.  \n`r qend()`\n`r solbegin(label=\"1 - fixed effects\", slabel=F,show=T, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nWe want to know if how anxiety (`GAD`) changes over time (`visit`) is different between treatment and control (`group`).  \n\nHopefully this should hopefully come as no surprise^[if it does, head back to where we learned about interactions in the single level regressions `lm()`.

To correctly group the observations into different patients (and not 'patient numbers'), we need to have `therapist:patient`.  \n\nSo we capture therapist-level differences in `( ... | therapist)` and the patients-within-therapist-level differences in `( ... | therapist:patient)`:  \n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nlmer(GAD ~ visit * group + ...\n       ( ... | therapist) + \n       ( ... | therapist:patient),\n     data = geduc_long)\n```\n\n\n`r solend()`\n`r solbegin(label=\"3 - random effects\", slabel=F,show=T, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nNote that each patient can change differently in their anxiety levels over time - i.e. the slope of `visit` could vary by participant.  \n\nLikewise, some therapists could have patients who change differently from patients from another therapist, so `visit|therapist` can be included.  \n\nEach patient is in one of the two groups - they're _either_ treatment _or_ control. So we can't say that \"differences in anxiety due to treatment varies between patients\", because for any one patient the \"difference in anxiety due to treatment\" is not defined in our study design.  \n\nHowever, therapists see multiple different patients, some of which are in the treatment group, and some of which are in the control group. So the treatment effect _could_ be different for different therapists!  \n\n```{r}\nmod1 <- lmer(GAD ~ visit*group + \n               (1+visit*group|therapist)+\n               (1+visit|therapist:patient),\n             geduc_long)\n```\n\n`r solend()`\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`\nFor each of the models below, what is wrong with the random effect structure?  \n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nmodelA <- lmer(GAD ~ visit*group + \n               (1+visit*group|therapist)+\n               (1+visit|patient),\n             geduc_long)\n```\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nmodelB <- lmer(GAD ~ visit*group + \n               (1+visit*group|therapist/patient),\n             geduc_long)\n```\n\n\n`r qend()`\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nmodelA <- lmer(GAD ~ visit*group + \n               (1+visit*group|therapist)+\n               (1+visit|patient),\n             geduc_long)\n```\n\nThe `patient` variable doesn't capture the different patients _within_ therapists, so this actually fits crossed random effects and treats all data where `patient==1` as from the same group (even if this includes several different patients' worth of data from different therapists!)\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nmodelB <- lmer(GAD ~ visit*group + \n               (1+visit*group|therapist/patient),\n             geduc_long)\n```\n\nUsing the `/` here means we have the same random slopes fitted for therapists and for patients-within-therapists. but the effect of group can't vary by patient, so this doesn't work. hence why we need to split them up into `(...|therapist)+(...|therapist:patient)`.  \n\n`r solend()`\n\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`\nLet's suppose that I don't want the psychoeducation treatment, I just want the standard therapy sessions that the 'Control' group received.

The recall tests were composed of 175 items identified by a keyword (`Test_word`). \n\nThe critical (replication) prediction is that the `StudyStudy` group recall more items on the immediate test, but the `StudyTest` group will retain the material better and thus perform better on the 1-week follow-up test.  \n\nThe following code loads the data into your R environment by creating a variable called `tel`:\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nload(url(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/testenhancedlearning.RData\"))\n```\n\n```{r} \n#| echo: false\n#| label: tbl-teldict\n#| tbl-cap: \"Data Dictionary: testenhancedlearning.Rdata\"\nload(url(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/testenhancedlearning.RData\"))\ntibble(\n  variable=names(tel),\n  description=c(\"Unique Participant Identifier\", \"Group denoting whether the participant studied the material twice (StudyStudy), or studied it once then did a test (StudyTest)\",\"Time of recall test ('min' = Immediate, 'week' = One week later)\",\"Word being recalled (175 different test words)\",\"Whether or not the word was correctly recalled\",\"Time to recall word (milliseconds)\")\n) |>\n    kableExtra::kbl() |>\n    kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)\n```\n\n:::\n\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`\nLoad and plot the data.

Is the effect of Delay likely to vary by test-words? More so than the effect of group is likely to vary by test-words?  \nQuite possibly - it's reasonable to think that some words will be more easily retained over a week than others, but I can't come up with a reason to think why `StudyTest` vs `StudyStudy` would have a different effect for some words than others.  \n\nLet's remove the by-testword random effect of group. \n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nmod3 <- glmer(Correct ~ Delay*Group +\n             (1 + Delay | Subject_ID) +\n             (1 + Delay | Test_word),\n             family=binomial, data=tel)\n```\n\nThis one converges!

However, note that this function has a tolerance, which is by default set to 1e-4, or 0.0001. Change this to 1e-3, and it indicates a problem.  \n```{r}\nisSingular(mod3, tol=1e-3)\n```\n\nSo we're kind of in a grey area that suggests we are close to overfitting here, so it might be worth continuing to simplify.  \n\n\n`r solend()`\n`r solbegin(label=\"4 - Removing Delay|Test_word\", slabel=F,show=T, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nmod4 <- glmer(Correct ~ Delay*Group +\n             (1 + Delay | Subject_ID) +\n             (1 | Test_word),\n             family=binomial, data=tel)\n```\nEven when we raise the tolerance here, we're still fine:  \n```{r}\nisSingular(mod4, tol=1e-3)\n```\nAnd here's our random effects: \n```{r}\nVarCorr(mod4)\n```\n\n`r solend()`\n`r solbegin(label=\"5 - Comparisons\", slabel=F,show=T, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nIn the process of getting to our final model, we've just fitted quite a few models that didn't converge.

Is that right?  \n```{r}\nn_distinct(pvt$child)\n```\n\nGiven that the `pvt$child` variable is just the first name of the child, it's entirely likely that there will be, for instance more than one \"Martin\".  \n\nThis says that there are 487!  \n```{r}\npvt |> count(school, child) |> nrow()\n```\n\nBut wait... we could _still_ have issues. What if there were 2 \"Martin\"s at the same school??\n```{r}\npvt |> \n  # count the school-children groups\n  count(school, child) |> \n  # arrange the output so that the highest \n  # values of the 'n' column are at the top\n  arrange(desc(n))\n```\n\nAha! There are 7 cases where schools have two children of the same name. Remember that each child was measured at 7 timepoints. We shouldn't have people with 14!  \n\nIf we actually _look_ at the data, we'll see that it is very neatly organised, with each child's data together. This means that we could feasibly make an educated guess that, e.g., the \"Jackson\" from \"School 3\" in rows 155-161 is different from the \"Jackson\" from \"School 3\" at rows 190-196. \n\nBecause of the ordering of our data, we can do something like this:  \n```{r}\npvt <- \n  pvt |>\n  # group by the school and child\n  group_by(school, child) |>\n  mutate(\n    # make a new variable which counts from 1 to \n    # the number of rows for each school-child\n    n_obs = 1:n()\n  ) |>\n  # ungroup the data\n  ungroup() |>\n  mutate(\n    # change it so that if the n_obs is >7, the \n    # child becomes \"[name] 2\", to indicate they're the second\n    # child with that name\n    child = ifelse(n_obs>7, paste0(child,\" 2\"), child)\n  )\n```\n\nNow we have 494!  \n```{r}\npvt |> count(school, child) |> nrow()\n```\n\nAnd nobody has anything other than 7 observations!\n```{r}\npvt |> count(school, child) |>\n  filter(n != 7)\n```\n\nPhew!  \n\nOkay, let's just fit an intercept-only model:  \n```{r}\n# pvt <- read_csv(\"../../data/bntmono.csv\")\npvt_null <- lmer(PVT ~ 1 +  (1 | school/child), data = pvt)\nsummary(pvt_null)\n```\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\nvcres = VarCorr(pvt_null) |> as.data.frame()\nvcres = round(vcres$vcov,2)\n```\n\n\nAs we can see from `summary(bnt_null)`, the random intercept variances are `r vcres[1]` for child-level, `r vcres[2]` for school-level, and the residual variance is `r vcres[3]`.\n\nSo child level differences account for $\\frac{`r vcres[1]`}{`r paste0(vcres,collapse=\" + \")`} = `r round(vcres[1]/sum(vcres),2)`$ of the variance in PVT scores, and child & school differences together account for $\\frac{`r paste0(vcres[1:2],collapse=\" + \")`}{`r paste0(vcres,collapse=\" + \")`} = `r round(sum(vcres[1:2])/sum(vcres),2)`$ of the variance.\n\nHere's an initial plot too:\n\n```{r}\nggplot(pvt, aes(x=age,y=PVT,col=factor(isBilingual)))+\n  stat_summary(geom=\"pointrange\")+\n  stat_summary(geom=\"line\")\n```\n\nI feel like either raw or orthogonal polynomials would be fine here - there's nothing explicit from the study background about stuff \"at baseline\". There's the stuff about the plateau at 7 or 8, but we can get that from the model plots. Orthogonal will allow us to compare the trajectories overall (their linear trend, the 'curviness' and 'wiggliness').  \n\nAn additional benefit of orthogonal polynomials is that we are less likely to get singular fits when we include polynomial terms in our random effects. Remember, raw polynomials are correlated, so often the by-participant variances in raw poly terms are highly correlated. \n\nI've gone for 3 degrees of polynomials here because the plot above shows a bit of an S-shape for the bilinguals. \n\n```{r}\npvt <- pvt |> mutate(\n  poly1 = poly(age, 3)[,1],\n  poly2 = poly(age, 3)[,2],\n  poly3 = poly(age, 3)[,3],\n  isBilingual = factor(isBilingual)\n)\n```\n\nThese models do not converge.  \nI've tried to preserve the by-child random effects of time, because while I think Schools probably _do_ vary, School's all teach the same curriculum, whereas there's _a lot_ of varied things that can influence a child's vocabulary, both in and out of school  \n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nmod1 <- lmer(PVT ~ 1 + (poly1 + poly2 + poly3) * isBilingual + \n       (1 + (poly1 + poly2 + poly3)*isBilingual | school) + \n       (1 + (poly1 + poly2 + poly3) | school:child),\n     data = pvt)\n\nmod2 <- lmer(PVT ~ 1 + (poly1 + poly2 + poly3) * isBilingual + \n       (1 + isBilingual * (poly1 + poly2) + poly3 | school) +\n       (1 + (poly1 + poly2 + poly3) | school:child),\n     data = pvt)\n\nmod3 <- lmer(PVT ~ 1 + (poly1 + poly2 + poly3) * isBilingual + \n       (1 + isBilingual * poly1 + poly2 + poly3 | school) +\n       (1 + (poly1 + poly2 + poly3) | school:child),\n     data = pvt)\n\nmod4 <- lmer(PVT ~ 1 + (poly1 + poly2 + poly3) * isBilingual + \n       (1 + isBilingual + poly1 + poly2 + poly3 | school) +\n       (1 + (poly1 + poly2 + poly3) | school:child),\n     data = pvt)\n\nmod5 <- lmer(PVT ~ 1 + (poly1 + poly2 + poly3) * isBilingual + \n       (1 + isBilingual + poly1 + poly3 | school) +\n       (1 + (poly1 + poly2 + poly3) | school:child),\n     data = pvt)\n# relative to the variance in time slopes, there's v little by-school variance in bilingual differences in vocab\n\nmod6 <- lmer(PVT ~ 1 + (poly1 + poly2 + poly3) * isBilingual + \n       (1 + poly1 + poly2 +  poly3 | school) +\n       (1 + (poly1 + poly2 + poly3) | school:child),\n     data = pvt)\n# looks like curvature doesn't vary between schools much as linear and wiggliness \n```\n\nthis one does! \n```{r}\nmod7 <- lmer(PVT ~ 1 + (poly1 + poly2 + poly3) * isBilingual + \n       (1 + poly1 + poly3 | school) +\n       (1 + (poly1 + poly2 + poly3) | school:child),\n     data = pvt)\n```\n\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(broom.mixed)\naugment(mod7) |> \n  mutate(\n    poly1 = round(poly1, 3) # because of rounding errors that make plot weird\n  ) |>\n  ggplot(aes(x=poly1,col=isBilingual))+\n  stat_summary(geom=\"pointrange\",aes(y=PVT))+\n  stat_summary(geom=\"line\", aes(y=.fitted))\n```\n\nrefitted with lmerTest:  \n```{r}\nmod7 <- lmerTest::lmer(PVT ~ 1 + (poly1 + poly2 + poly3) * isBilingual + \n       (1 + poly1 + poly3 | school) +\n       (1 + (poly1 + poly2 + poly3) | school:child),\n     data = pvt)\n\nsummary(mod7)\n```\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\nmm <- lmerTest::lmer(PVT ~ 1 + (poly1 + poly2 + poly3) * isBilingual + \n       (1 + poly1 + poly3 | school) +\n       (1 + (poly1 + poly2 + poly3) | school:child),\n     data = pvt)\n\ntidy(mm) |> filter(effect==\"fixed\") |> transmute(\n  term,\n  est = round(estimate,2),\n  p = ifelse(p.value<.05,\"*\",\"\"),\n  interpretation = c(\n    \"average vocab score at the mean age (for monolingual)\",\n    \"vocab increases over time (for monolingual children)\",\n    \"the increase in vocab becomes more gradual (for monolingual children)\",\n    \"no significant wiggliness to vocab trajectory of the average monolingual child\",\n    \"average vocab score at mean age is lower for bilingual vs monolingual children\",\n    \"no significant difference in linear trend of vocab for bilingual vs monolingual\",\n    \"curvature for vocab trajectory of bilingual children significantly differs from that of monolinguals\",\n    \"wiggliness for vocab trajectory of bilingual children significantly differs from that of monolinguals\"\n  )\n) |> gt::gt()\n```\n\nFrom the random effects, we get even more information!  \nSchool's vary in the average child vocab score at mean age with an SD of 4.5.  More school level variation in linear trends than in curvature. Schools with higher vocab scores at the mean age tend to have lower linear increase, and also a more negative curvature.  \nWithin schools, children vary in the vocab scores at mean age with an SD of 5.9. Lots of child-level variation in curvature and linear increases, slightly less variation in wiggliness. \n\n```{r}\nVarCorr(mod7)\n```\n\n\n\n<!-- ::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"} -->\n<!-- #### optional extra: plotting uncertainty of fixed effects -->\n\n<!-- We've seen a few times that taking all the fitted values and averaging can give us the trajectories. But we've also seen that this can cause issues if we have missing data, or unbalanced designs.
