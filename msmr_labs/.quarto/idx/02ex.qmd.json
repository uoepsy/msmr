Our data includes 4 species of great apes: Chimpanzees, Bonobos, Gorillas and Orangutans. Each ape has been assessed on a primate dominance scale at various ages. Data collection was not very rigorous, so apes do not have consistent assessment schedules (i.e., one may have been assessed at ages 1, 3 and 6, whereas another at ages 2 and 8).  \n\nThe researchers are interested in examining how the adolescent development of dominance in great apes differs between species.  \n\nData on the dominance scores of the apes are available at [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/msmr_apeage.csv](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/msmr_apeage.csv){target=\"_blank\"} and the information about which species each ape is are in [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/msmr_apespecies.csv](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/msmr_apespecies.csv){target=\"_blank\"}.  \n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"45%\"}\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| label: tbl-spec1\n#| tbl-cap: \"Data Dictionary: msmr_apespecies.csv\"  \nape_species <- read_csv(\"../../data/msmr_apespecies.csv\")\ntibble(\n  variable = names(ape_species),\n  description = c(\"Ape Name\",\"Species (Bonobo, Chimpanzee, Gorilla, Orangutan)\")\n) |> gt::gt()\n```\n:::\n::: {.column width=\"10%\"}\n\n:::\n::: {.column width=\"45%\"}\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| label: tbl-spec2\n#| tbl-cap: \"Data Dictionary: msmr_apeage.csv\"  \nape_age <- read_csv(\"../../data/msmr_apeage.csv\")\ntibble(\n  variable = names(ape_age),\n  description = c(\"Ape Name\",\"Age at assessment (years)\",\"Dominance (Z-scored)\")\n) |> gt::gt()\n```\n\n:::\n::::\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`\nRead in the data and check over it.

These include:\n\n- `union(x,y)` - return everything that is in set x or in set y (or both)\n- `intersect(x,y)` - return everything that is in both x and y\n- `setdiff(x,y)` - return everything in x that is not in y (*not there's asymmetry here!*)\n- `setequal(x,y)` - are sets x and y equal?\n\nSo we can use these to ask if, e.g., the two sets of apes in each dataset are equal:\n```{r}\nsetequal(ape_species$ape,ape_age$ape)\n```\n\nIf you want a fun^[really!?!?] challenge, there are lots of other (less concise ways) that we can ask the same thing. Try and come up with a few different ways.  \nE.g.: \"is there anything in the union of the two sets that is not in the intersection of the two sets?\"\n```{r}\nsetdiff(union(ape_species$ape,ape_age$ape), \n        intersect(ape_species$ape,ape_age$ape))\n```\n\n:::\n\nOkay, both datasets contain data for the same set of apes.  \nLet's join them:  \n```{r}\napedat <- full_join(ape_age, ape_species)\nhead(apedat)\n```\n`r solend()`\n`r solbegin(label=\"2 - identifying issues\", slabel=F,show=T, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nFirst off, we can see that we've got some weird typos.

We'll need to combine those.  \n```{r}\ntable(apedat$species)\n```\n\n\nAge looks like it has some weird values (possibly \"-99\"?), and there are possibly a few outliers in the dominance variable. Given that dominance is standardised, it is _extremely_ unlikely that we would see values around 20.. They're not \"impossible\", but they're so incredibly unlikely that I'd be more comfortable assuming they are typos: \n```{r echo=c(2,3)}\npar(mfrow=c(2,1))\nhist(apedat$age, breaks=20)\nhist(apedat$dominance, breaks=20)\npar(mfrow=c(1,1))\n```\n\nJust to see what the most extreme values of dominance are:  \n```{r}\n# show the biggest 5 absolute values in dominance variable\nsort(abs(apedat$dominance), decreasing = TRUE)[1:5]\n```\n\n`r solend()`\n`r solbegin(label=\"3 - cleaning up\", slabel=F,show=T, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\n\n```{r}\n\napedat <- apedat |> \n  mutate(\n    # fix species typos\n    species = case_when(\n      species %in% c(\"chimp\",\"chimpanzee\") ~ \"chimp\",\n      species %in% c(\"gorilla\",\"gorrila\") ~ \"gorilla\",\n      TRUE ~ species\n    )\n  ) |>\n    filter(\n      # get rid of ages -99\n      age > 0, \n      # keep when dominance is between -5 and 5 \n      # (5 here is a slightly arbitrary choice, but you can see from\n      # our checks that this will only exclude the two extreme datapoints\n      # that are 21.2 and 19.4\n      (dominance < 5 & dominance > -5) \n    )\n\n```\n\n`r solend()`\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`\nHow is this data structure \"hierarchical\" (or \"clustered\")?

Our data includes 4 species of great apes: Chimpanzees, Bonobos, Gorillas and Orangutans. Each ape has been assessed on a primate dominance scale at various ages. Data collection was not very rigorous, so apes do not have consistent assessment schedules (i.e., one may have been assessed at ages 1, 3 and 6, whereas another at ages 2 and 8).  \n\nThe researchers are interested in examining how the adolescent development of dominance in great apes differs between species.  \n\nData on the dominance scores of the apes are available at [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/msmr_apeage.csv](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/msmr_apeage.csv){target=\"_blank\"} and the information about which species each ape is are in [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/msmr_apespecies.csv](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/msmr_apespecies.csv){target=\"_blank\"}.  \n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"45%\"}\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| label: tbl-spec1\n#| tbl-cap: \"Data Dictionary: msmr_apespecies.csv\"  \nape_species <- read_csv(\"../../data/msmr_apespecies.csv\")\ntibble(\n  variable = names(ape_species),\n  description = c(\"Ape Name\",\"Species (Bonobo, Chimpanzee, Gorilla, Orangutan)\")\n) |> gt::gt()\n```\n:::\n::: {.column width=\"10%\"}\n\n:::\n::: {.column width=\"45%\"}\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| label: tbl-spec2\n#| tbl-cap: \"Data Dictionary: msmr_apeage.csv\"  \nape_age <- read_csv(\"../../data/msmr_apeage.csv\")\ntibble(\n  variable = names(ape_age),\n  description = c(\"Ape Name\",\"Age at assessment (years)\",\"Dominance (Z-scored)\")\n) |> gt::gt()\n```\n\n:::\n::::\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`\nRead in the data and check over it.

Be careful though - you can create the `Phase` variable out of the `Block` variable, so really this is just one piece of information, encoded differently in two variables. \n    - The other variables (`lesion_location` and `group`) do **not** vary for each ID. Lesions don't suddenly change where they are located, nor do participants swap between being a patient vs a control (we don't need the group variable anyway as we are excluding the controls).  \nWhat do you want your model to allow to vary within these groups?\n    - Do you think the change over the course of the blocks is **the same** for everybody?

As a reminder `!` is the negation function (not). As we saw in the earlier question, this excludes the 126 healthy controls, as well as the 9 patients for which we have missing values (NAs).\n\n__Note 2__:  \n\nWe didn't specify `(Phase | ID)` as the random effect because each participant only has 2 data points for Phase, and there is only one line that fits two data points. In other words, there is only one possible way to fit those two data points. As such, as each group of 2 points will have a perfect line fit, and the residuals $\\varepsilon_{ij}$ will all be 0. As a consequence of this, the residuals will have no variability as they are all 0, so $\\sigma_{\\epsilon}$ is 0 which in turn leads to problem with estimating the model coefficients.\n\n```{r}\nsubset(nwl_test, ID == 'patient15')\n```\n\nIf you try using `(Phase | ID)` as random effect, you will see the following message:\n\n`boundary (singular) fit: see help('isSingular')`\n\n`r solend()`\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`\n\n1.
