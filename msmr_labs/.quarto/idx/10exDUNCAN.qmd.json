Is it CFA? Is it Path Analysis? In fact it is both - it is the overarching framework of which CFA and Path Analysis are just particular cases. The beauty comes in when we put the CFA and Path Analysis approaches together.\n\nPath analysis, as we saw last week, offers a way of specifying and evaluating a *structural* model, in which variables relate to one another in various ways, via different (sometimes indirect) paths. Common models like our old friend multiple regression can be expressed in a Path Analysis framework.\n\nFactor Analysis, on the other hand, brings something absolutely crucial to the table - it allows us to mitigate some of the problems which are associated with measurement error by specifying the existence of some latent variable which is measured via some observed variables. No question can perfectly measure someone's level of \"anxiety\", but if we take a set of 10 carefully chosen questions, we can consider the shared covariance between those 10 questions to represent the construct that is common between all of them (they all ask, in different ways, about \"anxiety\"), also modeling the unique error with which each individual question represents the entire construct.  \n\nCombine them and we can reap the rewards of having both a *structural model* and a *measurement model*. The measurement model is our specification between the items we directly observed, and the latent variables of which we consider these items to be manifestations. The structural model is our specified model of the relationships between the latent variables.  \n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-semmdiag\n#| fig-cap: \"SEM diagram.

We first tested the measurement models for each construct by fitting a one-factor CFA model.  Latent variable scaling was by fixing the loading of the first item for each construct to 1.

The statistical significance of the indirect effects were evaluated using bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals with 1000 resamples.\n\nIn all cases models were fit using maximum likelihood estimation and model fit was judged to be good if CFI and TLI were $>.95$ and RMSEA and SRMR were $<.05$.
