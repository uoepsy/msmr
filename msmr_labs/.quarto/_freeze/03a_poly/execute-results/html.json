This might be \"over the course of adolescence\" (i.e. `y ~ age`), or \"over the course of an experiment\" (`y ~ trial_number`). The term **\"longitudinal\"** is commonly used to refer to any data in which repeated measurements are taken over a continuous domain. This opened up the potential for observations to be unevenly spaced, or missing at certain points. \n\nIt also, as will be the focus of this week, opens the door to thinking about how many effects of interest may display patterns that are **non-linear**. There are lots of techniques to try and summarise non-linear trajectories, and here we are going to focus on the method of including higher-order polynomials as predcitors.  \n  \n# Linear vs Non-Linear\n\nForget about multilevel models for a little while, as we can think about this in the single level world.  \n\nSuppose we had collected the data on 74 children, and measured the number of pathways in their brains (\"synaptic density\"), see @fig-dfeg. We wanted to fit a model to predict synaptic density based on the values of age.  \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsyndat <- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/msmr_synapticdens.csv\")\nggplot(syndat, aes(x=age,y=syndens))+\n  geom_point(size=2)+\n  labs(x=\"Age (years)\",y=\"Synaptic Density\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A clearly non-linear pattern](03a_poly_files/figure-html/fig-dfeg-1.png){#fig-dfeg fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe'll use our old friend linear regression, $y = b_0 + b_1 \\cdot x + \\varepsilon$.  \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlinmod <- lm(syndens ~ age, data = syndat)\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::: {.columns}\n::: {.column width=\"60%\"}\n\n\nWe'll get out some estimated coefficients, some $t$ statistics, and some p-values:  \n\n- The intercept: $b_0$ = 4.39, t(72)=8.17, p < .001  \n- The estimated coefficient of x: $b_1$ = 0.3, t(72)=8.17, p < .001   \n\nJob done? Clearly not - we need only overlay model upon raw data (@fig-dfeg2) to see we are missing some key parts of the pattern.  \n\n:::\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Uh-oh... ](03a_poly_files/figure-html/fig-dfeg2-1.png){#fig-dfeg2 fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n::::\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n#### We can see this in our residuals!!  \n\nLet's just do a quick `plot(model)` for some diagnostic plots of my linear model:\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(linmod)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03a_poly_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nDoes it look like the residuals are independently and identically distributed? Not really. We can see that the residuals do not have a constant mean of zero across the fitted values. This makes sense, because the line is below all of the points for people 5 years old, and then it's above all the points when $age<3$ and $age>15$. We need to find some way of incorporating the clearly non-linear relationship between the two variables into our model. \n\n:::\n\n\n# What is a polynomial?  \n\nFor many purposes, extending the linear model to include higher-order terms can allow us to usefully summarise a non-linear relationships between two variables. For instance, fitting models with linear and quadratic terms ($y$ = $b_0 + b_1 \\cdot x \\ + b_2 \\cdot x^2 + \\varepsilon$) and extending these to cubic ($y$ = $b_0 + b_1 \\cdot x \\ + b_2 \\cdot x^2 + b_3 \\cdot x^3 + \\varepsilon$) (or beyond), may aid in modelling nonlinear patterns, as in @fig-dfeg3\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Linear, quadratic and cubic models fitted to the same dataset.](03a_poly_files/figure-html/fig-dfeg3-1.png){#fig-dfeg3 fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n:::sticky\nPolynomials are mathematical expressions which involve a sum of powers. For instance:\n\n- $y = 4 + x + x^2$ is a second-order polynomial as the highest power of $x$ that appears is $x^2$  \n- $y = 9x + 2x^2 + 4x^3$ is a third-order polynomial as the highest power of $x$ that appears is $x^3$  \n- $y = x^6$ is a sixth-order polynomial as the highest power of $x$ that appears is $x^6$  \n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n#### How does a polynomial term capture non-linearity?   \n\nSuppose we have the model $y = b_0 + b_1 \\cdot x + \\varepsilon$. \nLet's take a sequence of values for $x$, and write out the model equation for the predicted values $\\hat y$ from this model.  \n\nWe can see that for each row, the predicted value increases by $b_1$. In the column with example coefficients, each row increases by 1.  \n\n\n| x | predicted y | predicted y if e.g. $b_0=1$ and $b_1=1$ |\n| ---- | ---- | ---- |\n| 0 | $b_0 + b_1 \\cdot 0$ | $1+1 \\cdot 0 = 1$ |\n| 1 | $b_0 + b_1 \\cdot 1$ | $1+1 \\cdot 1 = 2$ |\n| 2 | $b_0 + b_1 \\cdot 2$ | $1+1 \\cdot 2 = 3$ |\n| 3 | $b_0 + b_1 \\cdot 3$ | $1+1 \\cdot 3 = 4$ |\n| ... | ... | ... |\n\n\nNow let's do the same for the model with the quadratic term in, $y = b_0 + b_1 \\cdot x + b_2 \\cdot x^2 + \\varepsilon$.  \nWe can see now that each row doesn't increase by the same amount! The increases are 2, 4, 6 for our example coefficients.  \n\n\n| x | predicted y | predicted y if e.g. $b_0=1$, $b_1=1$ and $b_2=1$ |\n| ---- | ---- | ---- |\n| 0 | $b_0 + b_1 \\cdot 0 + b_2 \\cdot 0^2$ | $1+1 \\cdot 0 + 1 \\cdot 0^2 = 1$ |\n| 1 | $b_0 + b_1 \\cdot 1 + b_2 \\cdot 1^2$ | $1+1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 1^2 = 3$ |\n| 2 | $b_0 + b_1 \\cdot 2 + b_2 \\cdot 2^2$ | $1+1 \\cdot 2 + 1 \\cdot 2^2 = 7$ |\n| 3 | $b_0 + b_1 \\cdot 3 + b_2 \\cdot 3^2$ | $1+1 \\cdot 3 + 1 \\cdot 3^2 = 13$ |\n| ... | ... | ... |\n\nThis is because the value of $x^2$ is bigger for bigger values of $x$. Hence the difference between predicted values of $y$ when $x=9$ and $x=10$ is much bigger than it is between $x=0$ and $x=1$.  \n\nYou can see the linear and the quadratic lines we just talked about in the figure below:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03a_poly_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::: {.columns}\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\nAs the order of polynomials increases, we tend to be less interested in these terms in our model. Linear change is the easiest to think about: are things going up? or down? (or neither?). Quadratic change is the next most interesting, and it may help to think of this as the \"rate of change\". For instance, in @fig-quad1, it is the quadratic term which differs between the two groups trajectories. \n:::\n::: {.column width=\"10%\"}\n:::\n::: {.column width=\"40%\"}\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Two lines for which the quadratic term differs](03a_poly_files/figure-html/fig-quad1-1.png){#fig-quad1 fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n::::\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Positive and negative coefficients for quadratic terms\n\nOne thing to focus on is the sign of the quadratic coefficient. When a quadratic term is positive, the curve is $\\cup$ shaped, and when it is negative, the curve is $\\cap$ shaped. \nTo help illustrate, consider what each value from -10 to 10 is when squared (they're all positive, as in the RH side of @fig-quad3)\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Negative quadratic term (Left) and Positive quadratic term (Right) lead to curvatures that are either U shaped (positive) or inverted-U shaped (negative)](03a_poly_files/figure-html/fig-quad3-1.png){#fig-quad3 fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## Raw Polynomials\n\n\nThere are two types of polynomial we can construct. \"Raw\" (or \"Natural\") polynomials are the straightforward ones that you would expect (example in the table below), where the original value of $x$ is squared/cubed. \n\n\n| $x$ | $x^2$ | $x^3$ |\n| ---- | ---- | ---- |\n| 1 | 1 | 1 |\n| 2 | 4 | 8 |\n| 3 | 9 | 27 |\n| 4 | 16 | 64 |\n| 5 | 25 | 125 |\n| ... | ... | ... |\n\n\nWe can quickly get these in R using the `poly()` function.

The `poly1`, `poly2` and `poly3` coefficient represent the independent overall linear trend, centered curvature, and \"wiggliness\" of the relationship between synaptic density and age (as shown in the blue, green and orange lines in @fig-polycoeforth respectively).  \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![the independent rate of change (blue), curvature (green) and wiggliness (orange) of the y~x relationship](03a_poly_files/figure-html/fig-polycoeforth-1.png){#fig-polycoeforth fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Raw vs Orthognal  \n\nThe two models we have seen, one with raw polynomials, and one with orthogonal polynomials, are identical.  \n\nFor proof, compare the two:  \n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nanova(\n  lm(syndens ~ poly(age, 3, raw = TRUE), data = syndat),\n  lm(syndens ~ poly(age, 3, raw = FALSE), data = syndat)\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nAnalysis of Variance Table\n\nModel 1: syndens ~ poly(age, 3, raw = TRUE)\nModel 2: syndens ~ poly(age, 3, raw = FALSE)\n  Res.Df    RSS Df   Sum of Sq F Pr(>F)\n1     70 187.47                        \n2     70 187.47  0 -1.1369e-13         \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSo why would we choose one vs the other? \n\nThe main reason is if we are interested in evaluating things *relative to baseline*, in which case raw polynomials allow us to do just that.

It would, for instance, tell us that the linear trend for store2's earnings is upwards, whereas the linear trend for store 1 is flat. This makes store2 look better.  \nIf we used orthogonal polynomials instead, we would see that the linear trend for store 2 is actually *negative* compared to store1. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03a_poly_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-28-1.png){fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n::::\n\n:::sticky\n\nRaw?

Interestingly, this phenomenon has even been observed in other primates, such as chimpanzees.  \n\nThe present study is interested in examining whether the 'middle-age slump' happens to a similar extent for Orangutans as it does for Chimpanzees. \n\n200 apes (117 Chimps and 83 Orangutans) were included in the study. All apes were studied from early adulthood (10-12 years old for most great apes), and researchers administered the Happiness in Primates (HiP) scale to each participant every 3 years, up until the age of 40.  \n\nThe data are available at [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/midlife_ape.csv](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/midlife_ape.csv){target=\"_blank\"}.  \n\nThe dataset has already been cleaned, and the researchers have confirmed that it includes 117 Chimps and 83 Orangutans, and every ape has complete data (i.e. 10 rows for each ape).

But we've just said that we're interested in the curvature of this, so we're going to re-express `age` as the two parts, the linear and the quadratic:  \n```\nlmer(HiP ~ poly1 + poly2 ....\n```\nWe're interested in the differences in the \"hapiness ~ age\" relationship between Orangutans and Chimps, so we can estimate species-differences in both aspects of the trajectroy (the linear and the quadratic).  \n```\nlmer(HiP ~ (poly1 + poly2) * species ....\n```\nthis is equivalent to\n```\nlmer(HiP ~ poly1 + poly2 + species + \n           poly1:species + poly2:species ....\n```\n\nFinally, we want to account for the variability in happiness due to random ape-to-ape differences (i.e. some are just happy, some are not).  \n```\nlmer(HiP ~ (poly1 + poly2) * species + \n           (1 + ... | apeID), data = mlape)\n```\n\nLastly, it's very likely that 'change over time' varies from ape-to-ape, so we want to allow the slopes of age to vary. We can allow one or both of the poly1 and poly2 terms to vary, so we'll start with both:  \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(lme4)\nmod1 = lmer(HiP ~ 1 + (poly1+poly2)*species+\n            (1+poly1+poly2|apeID), \n            data = mlape)\n```\n:::\n\n\nand it converges (hooray!). \n\nNow let's plot the average value of happiness across time, alongside the average _predicted_ value.  \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbroom.mixed::augment(mod1) |>\n  mutate(poly1 = round(poly1,4)) |>\n  ggplot(aes(x=poly1,y=.fitted,col=species))+\n  # the average value across time: \n  stat_summary(geom=\"pointrange\",aes(y=HiP))+\n  # the average model predicted value\n  stat_summary(geom=\"line\") + \n  scale_color_manual(values=c(\"grey40\",\"darkorange\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03a_poly_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-36-1.png){fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt looks like both species have a bit of curvature, and this may be more pronounced for chimps than for orangutans.  \n\nLet's look at our parameters to see:  \n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# fitted with satterthwaite to get some p-values\nlmerTest::lmer(HiP ~ 1 + (poly1+poly2)*species+\n            (1+poly1+poly2|apeID), \n            data = mlape) |>\n  summary()\n```\n:::\n\n```\n...\nFixed effects:\n                       Estimate Std.
