Schools are nested within districts.  \n- each observation is an individual assessment, and we have multiple assessments for each patient, and patients are nested within hospitals. \n- each observation is an individual timepoint, and we have multiple timepoint per child. children are nested within schools  \n\nThis sort of structure is referred to as \"nested\" in that at each level, individual units belong to only _one_ of the higher up units. For instance, in a \"observations within children within schools\" structure, each observation belongs to only one child, and each child is at only one school. You can see this idea in @fig-nesting\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A 'nested' structure, in which each level 1 unit belongs to a single level 2 unit, and each level 2 unit belongs to a single level 3 unit](images/structure_nestednew.png){#fig-nesting fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nIn R, we can specify a nested structure using:  \n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n... + (1 + ... | school) + (1 + .... | school:child)\n```\n:::\n\nThis specifies that things can vary between schools and that things can also vary between the children within the schools.  \n\nSo `(1 | school) + (1 | school:child)` means that the intercept varies by school (some schools have a higher $y$, some have lower), and also by the children within the schools (some children have a higher $y$ for the school, some have lower).  \n\nYou might think of this as the variance in school intercepts (width of purple distribution in @fig-intnest) and the variance in child intercepts around their school average (width of the right-hand distributions in @fig-intnest). In @fig-intnest below there is a lot of school-level variation, and less child-level variation, but you could just as likely have a situation in which children that vary a lot and schools vary less. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Lines for each child from 12 Schools. Purple distribution shows school-level variance in intercepts.

It's always worth checking that these match with how many you would expect!__   \n\n\n:::\n\n\n<div class=\"divider div-transparent div-dot\"></div>\n\n# Crossed\n\n\n\n\n\nCrossed structures are, in simplest terms, anything that is not nested. So if a unit of observation exists in more than one of another level, we have a crossed design - i.e. where there is not the same hierarchy to the structure.   \n\nFor instance:  \n\n- Each observation is an assessment of a patient by a therapist. Patients see various therapists, and therapists see many different patients (patients and therapists are not nested)\n- Each observation is an individual trial, which will be one from a set of experimental items. All participants see all items, but all items are seen by all participants, so items and participants are not nested. \n\nThis sort of structure is referred to as \"crossed\" because of the lines crossing in such diagrams as in @fig-crossed. In @fig-crossed, observations can be grouped into tasks, but they can also be grouped into participants.  \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A 'crossed' structure](images/structure_crossednew.png){#fig-crossed fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn R, we simply specify these as separate groupings\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n... + (1 + ... | participant) + (1 + .... | task)\n```\n:::\n\nThis specifies that things can vary between participants, and that things can also vary between tasks.  \n\nSo `(1 | participant) + (1 | task)` means that the intercept varies by participant (some people have a higher $y$, some have lower),b and also by tasks (some tasks result in a higher $y$, some lower).  \n\nIt's a bit more difficult to visualise, but @fig-crosstest shows two independent distributions representing the intercept variance between Participants (left) and between Tasks (right). \n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A crossed design, with participant level variance (left) and task level variance (right)](04a_ranef_files/figure-html/fig-crosstest-1.png){#fig-crosstest fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can see in @fig-crosstest, for instance, that \"PPT_9\" tends to have a higher $y$, and that \"Task_5\" tends to have lower scores etc. Combined, these imply our model fitted values as shown for just 4 of the participants in @fig-crosstest2.  \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![fitted values from a crossed design for a sample of 4 participants](04a_ranef_files/figure-html/fig-crosstest2-1.png){#fig-crosstest2 fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n# Examples\n\n## Example 1: Two levels\n\nBelow is an example of a study that has a similar structure to those that we've seen thus far, in which we have just two levels (observations that are grouped in some way).  \n\n::::panelset\n:::panel\n#### Study Design\n\nSuppose, for instance, that we conducted an experiment on a sample of 20 staff members from the Psychology department to investigate effects of CBD consumption on stress over the course of the working week.

In our initial study design, we had just one self report measure of stress each day for each person.  \nHowever, we might just as easily have taken more measurements. i.e. on Day 1, we could have recorded Martin's stress levels 10 times. Furthermore, we could have used 10 different measurements of stress, rather than just a self-report measure. We could measure his cortisol levels, blood pressure, heart rate variability, give him different questionnaires, ask an informant like his son to report his stress, and so on. And we could have done the same for everybody.  \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstresscross <- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/stressweek_crossed.csv\")\nhead(stresscross)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 6 Ã— 6\n  dept  pid   CBD   measure          day stress\n  <chr> <chr> <chr> <chr>          <dbl>  <dbl>\n1 Psych Aja   N     Alpha-Amylase      1  0.269\n2 Psych Aja   N     Blood Pressure     1  0.855\n3 Psych Aja   N     Cortisol           1  0.278\n4 Psych Aja   N     EEQ                1  0.470\n5 Psych Aja   N     HRV                1 -0.404\n6 Psych Aja   N     Informant          1  0.774\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn this case, we can group our participants in two different ways.

And there is no hierarchy here - the \"blood pressure\" measure is the same measure for Martin as it is for Dan and Aja etc. It makes sense to think of by-measure variability as not being 'within-participants'.  \n\nThis means we can choose when plotting whether to split the plots by participants, with a different line for each measure (@fig-crosseg), or split by measure with a different line for each participant (@fig-crosseg1)\n\n::::panelset\n:::panel\n#### facet = participant, line = measure\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\nggplot(stresscross, aes(x=day, y=stress, col=CBD))+\n  geom_point()+\n  #make a line for each measure\n  geom_line(aes(group=measure))+\n  facet_wrap(~pid)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![crossed designs with participants and measures. we can facet by participant and plot a line for each measure](04a_ranef_files/figure-html/fig-crosseg-1.png){#fig-crosseg fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n:::panel\n#### facet = measure, line = participant\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\nggplot(stresscross, aes(x=day, y=stress, col=CBD))+\n  geom_point()+\n  # make a line for each ppt\n  geom_line(aes(group=pid))+\n  facet_wrap(~measure)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![crossed designs with participants and measures. we can facet by measure and plot a line for each participant](04a_ranef_files/figure-html/fig-crosseg1-1.png){#fig-crosseg1 fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n::::\n\n\nWe can fit a model that therefore accounts for the by-participant variation (\"things vary between participants\") _and_ the by-measure variation (\"things vary between measures\"). \n\nSo a model might look something like this:  \n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# re-center 'day' so the intercept is day 1\nstresscross$day <- stresscross$day-1\n\nmcross <- lmer(stress ~ 1 + day * CBD + \n                (1 + day * CBD | measure) +\n                (1 + day | pid), data = stresscross)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNote that just as with the nested example above, we can have different random slopes for measures vs those for participants, depending upon what effects can vary given the study design.  \n\nAs before, removing the interaction in the random effects achieves model convergence:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmcross2 <- lmer(stress ~ 1 + day * CBD + \n                (1 + day + CBD | measure) +\n                (1 + day | pid), data = stresscross)\n```\n:::\n\n\nAnd again we might plot our fitted values either of the ways we plotted our initial data in @fig-crosseg above, only with the `.fitted` values obtained from the `augment()` function:  \n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\naugment(mcross2) |>\n  ggplot(aes(x=day, y=.fitted, col=CBD))+\n    geom_point()+\n    geom_line(aes(group=pid))+\n    facet_wrap(~measure)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](04a_ranef_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-28-1.png){fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\nOur random effect variances show the estimated variance in different terms (the intercept, slopes of day, effect of CBD) between participants, and between measures.  \nFrom the below it is possible to see, for instance, that there is considerable variability between how measures respond to CBD (they vary in the effect of CBD on stress with a standard deviation of 0.53)\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(mcross2)\n```\n:::\n\n```\n...\nRandom effects:\n Groups   Name        Variance Std.Dev.

We can see that the measures of \"blood pressure\", \"alpha-amylase\", \"cortisol\", and \"HRV\" all have more effects of CBD that are more negative. We can see this in our plot of fitted values - these measures look like CBD vs control differnce is greater than in other measures. \n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndotplot.ranef.mer(ranef(mcross2))$measure\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](04a_ranef_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-31-1.png){fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<div class=\"divider div-transparent div-dot\"></div>\n\n# Model building\n\nRandom effect structures can get pretty complicated quite quickly. Very often it is not the random effects part that is of specific interest to us, but we wish to estimate random effects in order to more accurately partition up the variance in our outcome variable and provide better estimates of fixed effects.  \nIt is a fine balance between fitting the most sophisticated model structure that we possibly can, and fitting a model that converges without too much simplification. Typically for many research designs, the following steps will keep you mostly on track to finding the maximal model:  \n\n`lmer(outcome ~ fixed effects + (random effects | grouping structure))`  \n\n1. Specify the `outcome ~ fixed effects` bit first. \n    - The outcome variable should be clear: it is the variable we are wishing to explain/predict. \n    - The fixed effects are the things we want to use to explain/predict variation in the outcome variable. These will often be the things that are of specific inferential interest, and other covariates. Just like the simple linear model.  \n    \n2. If there is a grouping structure to your data, and those groups (preferably n>7 or 8) are perceived as a random sample of a wider population (the specific groups aren't interesting to you), then consider including random intercepts (and possibly random slopes of predictors) for those groups `(1 | grouping)`.  \n\n3. If there are multiple different grouping structures, is one nested within another? (If so, we can specify this as `(1 | high_level_grouping ) + (1 |  high_level_grouping:low_level_grouping)`.  If the grouping structures are not nested, we specify them as crossed: `(1 | grouping1) + (1 | grouping2)`.  \n\n\n4. If any of the things in the fixed effects vary within the groups, it might be possible to also include them as random effects.  \n    - as a general rule, don't specify random effects that are not also specified as fixed effects (an exception could be specifically for model comparison, to isolate the contribution of the fixed effect).  \n    - For things that do not vary within the groups, it rarely makes sense to include them as random effects. For instance if we had a model with `lmer(score ~ genetic_status + (1 + genetic_status | patient))` then we would be trying to model a process where \"the effect of genetic_status on scores is different for each patient\". But if you consider an individual patient, their genetic status never changes. For patient $i$, what is \"the effect of genetic status on score\"? It's undefined. This is because genetic status only varies _between_ patients.\n    - Sometimes, things will vary within one grouping, but not within another. E.g. with patients nested within hospitals `(1 | hospital) + (1 | hospital:patient)`, genetic_status varies _between_ patients, but _within_ hospitals. Therefore we could theoretically fit a random effect of `genetic_status | hospital`, but __not__ one for `genetic_status | patient`.  \n\n5. A common approach to fitting multilevel models is to fit the most complex model _that the study design allows_. This means including random effects for everything that makes _theoretical_ sense to be included. Because this \"maximal model\" will often not converge, we then simplify our random effect structure to obtain a convergent model.  \n\nThere is no _right_ way to simplify random effect structures - it's about what kind of simplifications we are willing to make (a subjective decision).  \n\nSome general pointers: \n\n- If we want to make inferences about a (within-group) fixed effect, we should ideally include it as a corresponding random effect, else we might get false positives.  \n- Complex terms like interactions (e.g. `(1 + x1 * x2 | group)` are often causes of non-convergence as they require more data to estimate group-level variability. This could be simplified to `(1 + x1 + x2 | group)`).  \n- Looking at at the random effects of a non-converging model can help point towards problematic terms. Look for random effects with little variance, or with near perfect correlation (we can alternatively remove just the correlation). \n- Random effects of categorical variables often result in the model attempting to estimate _a lot_ of variances and covariances. You could consider moving this to the right hand side `(1 + catX | group)` becoming `(1 | group) + (1 | group:catX)`\n\n6. Obtain final model, and proceed to checking assumptions, checking influence, plotting, and eventually writing up.  \n\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n#### model convergence\n\nIssues of non-convergence can be caused by many things. If your model doesn't converge, it does *not necessarily* mean the fit is incorrect, however it is **is cause for concern**, and should be addressed before using the model, else you may end up reporting inferences which do not hold.  \n\nThere are lots of different things which you could do which *might* help your model to converge. A select few are detailed below:  \n\n- double-check the model specification and the data  \n\n- adjust stopping (convergence) tolerances for the nonlinear optimizer, using the optCtrl argument to [g]lmerControl. (see `?convergence` for convergence controls). \n    - What is \"tolerance\"? Remember that our optimizer is the the method by which the computer finds the best fitting model, by iteratively assessing and trying to maximise the likelihood (or minimise the loss). \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![An optimizer will stop after a certain number of iterations, or when it meets a tolerance threshold](images/tolerance.png){#fig-tolerance fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n- center and scale continuous predictor variables (e.g. with `scale`)  \n\n- Change the optimization method (for example, here we change it to `bobyqa`):\n    `lmer(..., control = lmerControl(optimizer=\"bobyqa\"))`  \n    `glmer(..., control = glmerControl(optimizer=\"bobyqa\"))`  \n\n- Increase the number of optimization steps:\n    `lmer(..., control = lmerControl(optimizer=\"bobyqa\", optCtrl=list(maxfun=50000))`  \n    `glmer(..., control = glmerControl(optimizer=\"bobyqa\", optCtrl=list(maxfun=50000))`  \n\n- Use `allFit()` to try the fit with all available optimizers. This will of course be slow, but is considered 'the gold standard'; *\"if all optimizers converge to values that are practically equivalent, then we would consider the convergence warnings to be false positives.\"*  \n\n- Consider simplifying your model, for example by removing random effects with the smallest variance (but be careful to not simplify more than necessary, and ensure that your write up details these changes)\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n#### singular fits\n\nYou may have noticed that some of our models over the last few weeks have been giving a warning: `boundary (singular) fit: see ?isSingular`.   \nUp to now, we've been largely ignoring these warnings. However, this week we're going to look at how to deal with this issue.\n\n<p style=\"color:red\">boundary (singular) fit: see ?isSingular</p>\n\nThe warning is telling us that our model has resulted in a 'singular fit'. Singular fits often indicate that the model is 'overfitted' - that is, the random effects structure which we have specified is too complex to be supported by the data.  \n\nPerhaps the most intuitive advice would be remove the most complex part of the random effects structure (i.e. random slopes). This leads to a simpler model that is not over-fitted. In other words, start simplifying from the top (where the most complexity is) to the bottom (where the lowest complexity is).\nAdditionally, when variance estimates are very low for a specific random effect term, this indicates that the model is not estimating this parameter to differ much between the levels of your grouping variable. It might, in some experimental designs, be perfectly acceptable to remove this or simply include it as a fixed effect.\n\nA key point here is that when fitting a mixed model, we should think about how the data are generated. Asking yourself questions such as \"do we have good reason to assume subjects might vary over time, or to assume that they will have different starting points (i.e., different intercepts)?\" can help you in specifying your random effect structure\n\nYou can read in depth about what this means by reading the help documentation for `?isSingular`. For our purposes, a relevant section is copied below:  \n\n*... intercept-only models, or 2-dimensional random effects such as intercept + slope models, singularity is relatively easy to detect because it leads to random-effect variance estimates of (nearly) zero, or estimates of correlations that are (almost) exactly -1 or 1.*\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
