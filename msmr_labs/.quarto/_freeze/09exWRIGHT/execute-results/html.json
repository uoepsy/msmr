We specify our theoretical model of the world as a system of paths between variables that represent which variables influence which other variables. This is simply a diagramatic way of specifying a set of equations. \n    - A single headed arrow from $X \\rightarrow Y$ indicates that Y \"listens to\" X - if X changes, then Y will change accordingly (but not vice versa)\n    - A double headed arrow between $X \\leftrightarrow Y$ indicates that these two variables are related, not because one causes the other, but because there is some mechanism outside of our model that results in these two variables being associated.\n2. We collect data on the relevant variables and we observe a covariance matrix (i.e. how each variable covaries with every other variable). \n3. We fit our model to the data, and evaluate how well our theoretical model (the estimated values for our path coefficients) can reproduce the observed covariance matrix. \n\n\n:::sticky\n**Terminology**  \n\n- **Exogenous variables** are a bit like what we have been describing with words like \"independent variable\" or \"predictor\". In a path diagram, they have no arrows coming into them from other variables in the system, but have paths *going out* to other variables.  \n- **Endogenous variables** are more like the \"outcome\"/\"dependent\"/\"response\" variables we are used to. They have some arrow coming into them from another variable in the system (and may also - but not necessarily - have paths going out from them).  \n:::\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n## optional: The fun details!  \n\nFor Path Diagrams that meet a certain set of pre-requisites, we can use a cool technique called \"Path Tracing\" to move between the path estimates and the implied covariances between a set of variables. The process is much easier with correlations, so in the examples below everything is standardised to have a variance of 1, meaning that covariance == correlation.  \n\nFor us to be able to do this, a Path Diagram must meet these criteria:\n\n- The model has no two-way causal relations or feedback loops (e.g. $A \\rightarrow B \\rightarrow C \\rightarrow A$ ).  \n- All relations are linear and additive.  \n- 'causes' are unitary (if A -> B and A -> C, then it is presumed that this is the same aspect of A resulting in a change in both B and C, and not two distinct aspects of A, which would be better represented by two correlated variables A1 and A2).  \n- The variables are measured without error (we will relax this assumption later on by including latent variables).\n- Endogenous variables are not connected by correlations (we would correlate the residuals instead, because residuals are not endogenous).  \n- The residuals (error terms) are uncorrelated with exogenous variables.  \n- All our exogenous variables are correlated (unless we specifically assume that their correlation is zero).  \n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n#### causality?\n\nPath models allow us to reason about 'cause and effect', without having to conduct an experiment and manipulate a given variable. However, there is nothing special about the statistical machinery or techniques here that makes our results 'causal'. The extent to which we can claim 'causation' is entirely model-dependent. That is, the use of 'causal' refers to an assumption that our model includes all relevant causal relations (and captures them appropriately). When we test these models, a good fitting model does **not** prove that the causal assumptions are correct.  \n\n:::\n\n\n__Path Tracing Rules__  \n\nThanks to [Sewal Wright](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2527551.pdf?casa_token=3QF0ad2ZoBcAAAAA:MbEkDNNdoLZr1SXE4LrnK--qrhhsTXLgsRtcWre1UvWxiQiGNUl5vWytGp34XIxhAYMZJe-MbIcBnEwXSfX6MAONevz04-sMXpEDI3IaYKk6mMX46QvX), we can express the correlation between any two variables in the system as the sum of all *compound paths* between the two variables^[if we were wanting covariances, and we didn't have standardised variables, then these would have to be multiplied by the corresponding variance estimates for the variables].  \n\n*compound paths* are the products of any paths you can trace between A and B for which there are: \n\n- no loops\n- no going forward then backward (and no going forward then across a curved arrow)\n- maximum of one curved arrow per path\n\n::::panelset\n:::panel\n#### Example 1\n\nLet's consider the example below, for which the paths are all labelled with lower case letters $a, b, c, \\text{and } d$. In this case, we have two exogenous variables X1 and X2 that both influence a single outcome Y. This is actually just a multiple regression expressed as a path diagram!  \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A multiple regression model as a path diagram](images/patheq1.png){#fig-patheq1 fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAccording to Wright's tracing rules above, we can write out the equations corresponding to the 3 correlations between our observed variables (remember that $r_{a,b} = r_{b,a}$, so it doesn't matter at which variable we start the paths). \n\nThere is only one way to move between X1 and X2, according to Wright's rules, and that is to go via the double headed arrow $c$. There are two ways to go from X1 to Y - we can go across the double headed arrow to X2, and then go from X2 to y (path $bc$), or we can go directly from X1 to Y (path $a$). To get from X2 to Y, we can go either via X1 (path $ac$), or go directly (path $b$).  \n\n| covariance    | paths  |\n| ------------- | ------ |\n| $r_{x1,x2}$ | c      |\n| $r_{x1,y}$  | a + bc |\n| $r_{x2,y}$  | b + ac |\n\nSuppose that we fit this model to some data using something like our good friend maximum likelihood estimation, and we get some estimates for our path coefficients such as those below:  \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(lavaan)\n# our data:\negdata <- read_csv(\"../../data/path_eg1.csv\")\n# our model formula\nmod.formula <- \"y ~ x1 + x2\"\n# fitted to some data\nmod.est <- sem(mod.formula, data = egdata)\n# extract parameters:\nparTable(mod.est) |> select(lhs,op,rhs,est)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  lhs op rhs   est\n1   y  ~  x1 0.612\n2   y  ~  x2 0.382\n3   y ~~   y 0.310\n4  x1 ~~  x1 0.995\n5  x1 ~~  x2 0.359\n6  x2 ~~  x2 0.995\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWith this set of path estimates ($a = 0.61$, $b = 0.38$, and $c = 0.36$), we can calculate the correlation that is *implied* by our estimated model:  \n\n| covariance   | paths  | model implied correlation           |\n| ------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------- |\n| $r_{x1,x2}$ | c      | $0.36$                             |\n| $r_{x1,y}$  | a + bc | $0.61 + (0.38 \\times 0.36) = 0.75$ |\n| $r_{x2,y}$  | b + ac | $0.38 + (0.61 \\times 0.36) = 0.60$ |\n\nWe can then examine how far off this is from the observed covariance matrix. In this specific case, our covariance matrix has 6 values in it, and we are estimating 6 things (see the parameters above). This means that there is unique solution, and our model is **just-identified** (or \"saturated\"), and is capable of **perfectly** reproducing the covariance matrix.  \n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncov(egdata) |> round(2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n     x1   x2    y\nx1 1.00 0.36 0.75\nx2 0.36 1.00 0.60\ny  0.75 0.60 1.00\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n#### why 6? the model in full  \n\nThe variances of individual variables (also covariances of each variable with itself) are also in our covariance matrix on the diagonals, and in full, our model also includes the estimation of variances of exogenous variables, as well as the residual variance of endogenous variables.

In @fig-patheq2, we can see now a model in which we have two outcomes (Y1 and Y2), an exogenous predictor X, and a variable M that sits on the path between X and the two outcomes. In this case, M is itself an outcome of Z. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A model with 2 outcomes](images/patheq2.png){#fig-patheq2 fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nUsing the path tracing rules, there is only one way to get between X and M, and that is the path $a$. There is only one way to get between M and Y1 (path $b$), and only one way to get between M and Y2 (path $c$). To get between X and Y1, we can only go via $ab$, and to get between X and Y2, we can only go via $ac$. To get between Y1 and Y2, we can go backwards to M and then forwards to Y2, the path $bc$.   \n\n| covariance   | paths |\n| ------------ | ----- |\n| $r_{x,m}$  | a     |\n| $r_{m,y1}$ | b     |\n| $r_{m,y2}$ | c     |\n| $r_{x,y1}$ | ab    |\n| $r_{x,y2}$ | ac    |\n| $r_{y1,y2}$ | bc    |\n\nAs with the previous example, we fit our model to some sample data, and get some estimates for the parameters:  \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\n# our data:\negdata2 <- read_csv(\"../../data/path_eg2.csv\")\n# our model formula\nmod.formula <- \"\ny1 ~ m\ny2 ~ m\nm ~ x\n# by default, lavaan will correlate the residual variance\n# for the purposes of this example, to match our model exactly, \n# we'll constrain it to 0:  \ny1~~0*y2\n\"\n# fitted to some data\nmod.est <- sem(mod.formula, data = egdata2)\n# extract parameters:\nparTable(mod.est) |> select(lhs,op,rhs,est)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  lhs op rhs   est\n1  y1  ~   m 0.520\n2  y2  ~   m 0.187\n3   m  ~   x 0.461\n4  y1 ~~  y2 0.000\n5  y1 ~~  y1 0.728\n6  y2 ~~  y2 0.963\n7   m ~~   m 0.786\n8   x ~~   x 0.998\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnd the estimated path coefficients of $a = 0.46$, $b = 0.52$ and $c = 0.19$, imply that our covariances are:  \n\n| covariance   | paths | model implied covariance  |\n| ------------ | ----- | ------------------------- |\n| $r_{x,m}$  | a     | $0.46$                    |\n| $r_{m,y1}$ | b     | $0.52$                    |\n| $r_{m,y2}$ | c     | $0.19$                    |\n| $r_{x,y1}$ | ab    | $0.46 \\times 0.52 = 0.24$ |\n| $r_{x,y2}$ | ac    | $0.46 \\times 0.19 = 0.09$ |\n| $r_{y1,y2}$ | bc    | $0.52 \\times 0.19 = 0.10$ |\n\nFinally, our **observed** covariances are here:  \n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncov(egdata2) |> round(2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n     y1   y2    m    x\ny1 1.00 0.06 0.52 0.49\ny2 0.06 1.00 0.19 0.06\nm  0.52 0.19 1.00 0.46\nx  0.49 0.06 0.46 1.00\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBut wait.. unlike the first example, this one does _not_ perfectly reproduce our the covariances we observe. This is because our model is **over-identified**. We are trying to recreate our covariance matrix with 10 values in it using only **7** unknown parameters. This is a good thing! It means we can assess the fit of the model to the data, and evaluate the plausibility of the proposed relationships!  \n\nNotably, some of our \"model implied covariances\" are quite different to those in our observed covariance matrix (e.g, the model implies that $r_{x,y1} = 0.24$, but we actually observe it to be 0.49!).  \n\n:::\n:::panel\n#### Example 3\n\nIn Example 2, our theoretical model proposed that *all* of the association that we might observe between X and Y1 is due to the relationship that X has with M, and that M in turn has with Y1.  However, an alternative model (see @fig-patheq3) could propose that X still directly influences Y1 beyond the influence it exerts via M. We would indicate this via an additional path (path $g$ in @fig-patheq3).  \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![X now directly influences Y, as well as its influence via M](images/patheq3.png){#fig-patheq3 fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFitting this model (to the same data), we get out estimates for the paths (including this additional parameter): \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\n# our model formula\nmod.formula <- \"\ny1 ~ m + x\ny2 ~ m\nm ~ x\n# by default, lavaan will correlate the residual variance\n# for the purposes of this example, to match our model exactly, \n# we'll constrain it to 0:  \ny1~~0*y2\n\"\n# fitted to the same data as for example 2\nmod.est <- sem(mod.formula, data = egdata2)\n# extract parameters:\nparTable(mod.est) |> select(lhs,op,rhs,est)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  lhs op rhs   est\n1  y1  ~   m 0.375\n2  y1  ~   x 0.313\n3  y2  ~   m 0.187\n4   m  ~   x 0.461\n5  y1 ~~  y2 0.000\n6  y1 ~~  y1 0.651\n7  y2 ~~  y2 0.963\n8   m ~~   m 0.786\n9   x ~~   x 0.998\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOur covariances between variables are, in this model, expressed as: \n\n| covariance   | paths | model implied covariance |\n| ------------ | ----- | ------ |\n| $r_{x,m}$  | a     |  $0.46$  |\n| $r_{m,y1}$ | b + ag | $0.38 + (0.46 \\times 0.31) = 0.52$ |\n| $r_{m,y2}$ | c   |   $0.19$   |\n| $r_{x,y1}$ | ab + g | $(0.46 \\times 0.38) + 0.31 = 0.49$ |\n| $r_{x,y2}$ | ac    |  $0.46 \\times 0.19 = 0.09$  |\n| $r_{y1,y2}$ | bc + gac | $(0.38 \\times 0.19) + (0.31 \\times 0.46 \\times 0.19) = 0.10$  |\n\nAnd now, when we look at our observed covariance matrix, we are doing a much better job of recreating it, than we did with the model from Example 2!  \n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncov(egdata2) |> round(2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n     y1   y2    m    x\ny1 1.00 0.06 0.52 0.49\ny2 0.06 1.00 0.19 0.06\nm  0.52 0.19 1.00 0.46\nx  0.49 0.06 0.46 1.00\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n::::\n\n:::\n\n# Toy Example: Education and Salary\n\n\n:::frame\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(lavaan)\nset.seed(777)\ndf = tibble::tibble(\n  Educ = round(rnorm(390, 15.5, 3)),\n  Skill = scale(.6*scale(Educ) + rnorm(390))[,1],\n  Salary = scale(.12*scale(Educ) + .3*Skill + rnorm(390))[,1]*12.3 + 39.533\n)\n\nm=\"\nSalary ~ c*Educ + b*Skill\nSkill ~ a*Educ\nind:=a*b\ntotal:=a*b+c\n\"\nsem(m, df) |> summary()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nlavaan 0.6.17 ended normally after 1 iteration\n\n  Estimator                                         ML\n  Optimization method                           NLMINB\n  Number of model parameters                         5\n\n  Number of observations                           390\n\nModel Test User Model:\n                                                      \n  Test statistic                                 0.000\n  Degrees of freedom                                 0\n\nParameter Estimates:\n\n  Standard errors                             Standard\n  Information                                 Expected\n  Information saturated (h1) model          Structured\n\nRegressions:\n                   Estimate  Std.Err  z-value  P(>|z|)\n  Salary ~                                            \n    Educ       (c)    0.482    0.215    2.239    0.025\n    Skill      (b)    3.568    0.679    5.254    0.000\n  Skill ~                                             \n    Educ       (a)    0.166    0.014   12.125    0.000\n\nVariances:\n                   Estimate  Std.Err  z-value  P(>|z|)\n   .Salary          130.239    9.327   13.964    0.000\n   .Skill             0.724    0.052   13.964    0.000\n\nDefined Parameters:\n                   Estimate  Std.Err  z-value  P(>|z|)\n    ind               0.591    0.123    4.821    0.000\n    total             1.073    0.190    5.657    0.000\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#lm(Salary ~ Educ + Skill,df) |> summary()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n<div class='question-begin'>Question 1</div><div class='question-body'>\n\n\nread in the dataset.  \nsuppose that the only statistical machinery available is the good old regression models with `lm()`.
