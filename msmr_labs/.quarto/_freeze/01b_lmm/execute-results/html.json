The core idea is that **model parameters vary at more than one level.**. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![size weighted by hits on google scholar search (sept 2020)](01b_lmm_files/figure-html/fig-wordcloud-1.png){#fig-wordcloud fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n<div class=\"divider div-transparent div-dot\"></div>\n\n# Fixed effects\n\nIn the simple linear regression model was written as $\\color{red}{y} = \\color{blue}{b_0 + b_1x_1 \\ + \\ ... \\ + \\ b_px_p} \\color{black}{\\ + \\ \\varepsilon}$, the estimated coefficients $\\color{blue}{b_0}$, $\\color{blue}{b_1}$ etc., are estimated as **fixed** values - i.e. we estimate just one number for $b_0$, and one number for $b_1$, for $b_2$ and so on, and that's it.  \n\nIn the example where we model School children's grades as a function of their motivation score, when we fit a simple regression model of `lm(grade ~ motiv)`, the estimated parameters are two values that define a line - an intercept and a slope (as in @fig-schoolplot1).  \n \n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Grade predicted by motivation.

It's entirely possible (and likely) that there are school-level differences might actually account for quite a lot of the variation in grades (in [1A #ICC](01a_clustered.html#icc---quantifying-clustering-in-an-outcome-variable) we actually estimated this to account for approx 40% of the variation in grades).  \n\nTODO CHECK below\n\nWe saw how we might add in `school` as a predictor to our linear model to estimate all these school-level differences (`lm(grade ~ schoolid + motiv)`). This is a good start, and may oftentimes be perfectly acceptable if our clustering is simply a nuisance thing that we want to account for - adding in the clustering as another predictor will completely account for *all* cluster-level variability in our outcome variable.  \n\nHowever, more frequently these clusters are themselves additional units of observation that have features of interest to us. For instance, we may be interested in how the funding that a school receives moderates the association between childrens motivation and grades - i.e. we're interested in things that happen both at the child-level (motivation, grades), and at the school-level (funding). For these scenarios, we really need a multilevel model.  \n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n#### clusters as fixed effects\n\nWe have already seen that we can include fixed effects for cluster differences (we referred to this as \"no pooling\").  \n\ne.g. to fit school-level differences in grades, we could use:\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfemod <- lm(grade ~ motiv + schoolid, data = schoolmot)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe model equation for this would look something like:\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{For child }i& \\\\\n\\text{grade}_i =\\, &b_0 + b_1 \\cdot \\text{motiv}_i + b_2 \\cdot \\text{isSchool2}_i + b_3 \\cdot \\text{isSchool3}_i\\,\\, + \\,\\, ... \\,\\, + \\\\\n& ... + \\,\\, ... \\,\\, + \\,\\, ... \\,\\, + \\\\\n& b_p \\cdot \\text{isSchoolP}_i\\,\\, + \\epsilon_i \n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nThe school coefficients are a series of dummy variables that essentially toggle on or off depending on which school child $i$ is from. \n\nBecause these set of coefficients accoutn for **all** of the school-level differences in grades, it means we are then unable to consider other school-level variables like `funding` (how much govt funding the school receives). If we try, we can see that a coefficient for `funding` is not able to be estimated because `schoolid` is explaining everything school-related:    \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfemod2 <- lm(grade ~ motiv + schoolid + funding, data = schoolmot)\nsummary(femod2)\n```\n:::\n\n```\nCoefficients: (1 not defined because of singularities)\n                                   Estimate  Std.

It achieves this by taking some of the estimated coefficients $b_?$ in our linear regression model and modelling these as randomly varying by clusters (i.e. each cluster gets its own value of $b_?$).  \n\n\nLet's see how this works by starting with the intercept, $b_0$.  \n\n## random intercept \n\nTo extend the single-level regression model to the multi-level regression model, we add in an extra suffix to our equation to indicate which cluster an observation belongs to.^[Some books use \"cluster $j$ >> observation $i$\", others use \"cluster $i$ >> observation $j$\". We use the latter here] Then, we can take our coefficients $b_?$ and allow them to be different for each cluster $i$ by adding the suffix $b_{?i}$. Below, we have done this for our intercept $b_0$.  \n  \nHowever, we also need to _define_ these differences, and the multilevel model does this by expressing each cluster's intercept as a deviation ($\\zeta_{0i}$ for cluster $i$, below) from a fixed number ($\\gamma_{00}$, below). Because these differences are to do with the _clusters_ (and not the individual observations within them), we often write these as a \"level 2 equation\":    \n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{For observation }j&\\text{ in cluster }i \\\\\n\\text{Level 1:}& \\\\\ny_{ij} &= b_{0i} + b_1 \\cdot x_{ij} + \\epsilon_{ij} \\\\\n\\text{Level 2:}& \\\\\nb_{0i} &= \\gamma_{00} + \\zeta_{0i} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n#### mixed-effects notation  \n\nInstead of writing several equations at multiple levels, we substitute the Level 2 terms into the Level 1 equation to get something that is longer, but all in one:  \n\n$$\n\\color{red}{y_{ij}} = \\underbrace{(\\gamma_{00} + \\color{orange}{\\zeta_{0i}})}_{\\color{blue}{b_{0i}}} \\cdot 1 + \\color{blue}{b_{1}} \\cdot x_{ij}  +  \\varepsilon_{ij}\n$$  \n\nThis notation typically corresponds with the \"mixed effects\" terminology because parameters can now be a combination of both a fixed number and a random deviation, as in the intercept below:  \n\n$$\n\\color{red}{y_{ij}} = \\underbrace{(\\underbrace{\\gamma_{00}}_{\\textrm{fixed}} + \\color{orange}{\\underbrace{\\zeta_{0i}}_{\\textrm{random}}})}_{\\text{intercept, }b_{0i}} \\cdot 1 + \\underbrace{b_2}_{\\textrm{fixed}} \\cdot x_{ij} +  \\varepsilon_{ij}\n$$\n\n:::\n\nReturning to our school children's grade example, we can fit a model with \"random intercepts for schools\", which would account for the possibility that some schools have higher grades, some have lower grades, etc.  \n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{For Child }j\\text{ in School }i& \\\\\n\\text{Level 1 (child):}& \\\\\n\\text{grade}_{ij} &= b_{0i} + b_1 \\cdot \\text{motiv}_{ij} + \\epsilon_{ij} \\\\\n\\text{Level 2 (school):}& \\\\\nb_{0i} &= \\gamma_{00} + \\zeta_{0i} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$\nIf we consider one of our schools (e.g. \"Dyce Academy\") we can see that our model predicts that this school has higher grades than most other schools (@fig-ri_1school). We can see how this is modelled as a deviation $\\zeta_{0\\text{DA}}$ (DA for Dyce Academy) from some fixed value $\\gamma_{00}$.  \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Fitted values from a multilevel model with random intercepts for schools](01b_lmm_files/figure-html/fig-ri_1school-1.png){#fig-ri_1school fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTODO PANEL PLOT\n\nAt this point, you might be wondering how this is any different from simply fitting clusters as an additional predictor in a single level regression (i.e. a clusters-as-fixed-effect approach of `lm(grade ~ motiv + schoolid)`). This would also estimate an difference for each cluster?  \n\n:::sticky\nThe key to the multilevel model is that we are not actually estimating the cluster-specific differences themselves (although we can_ get these out). We are estimating a **distribution** of differences. \n:::\n\nSpecifically, the parameters of the multilevel model that are being estimated are the mean and _variance_ of a _normal_ distribution of clusters.  \n\nSo the parameters that are estimated from our model with a random intercept by-schools, are:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{For Child }j\\text{ in School }i& \\\\\n\\text{Level 1 (child):}& \\\\\n\\text{grade}_{ij} &= b_{0i} + b_1 \\cdot \\text{motiv}_{ij} + \\epsilon_{ij} \\\\\n\\text{Level 2 (school):}& \\\\\nb_{0i} &= \\gamma_{00} + \\zeta_{0i} \\\\\n\\text{where: }& \\\\\n&\\varepsilon_{ij} \\sim N(0,\\sigma_\\varepsilon) \\\\\n&\\zeta_{0i} \\sim N(0,\\sigma_0) \\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n\n- a fixed intercept $\\gamma_{00}$  \n- the variance with which schools deviate from the fixed intercept $\\sigma_0$  \n- a fixed slope for `motiv` $b_1$  \n- (and we also get the residual variance too, in $\\sigma_\\varepsilon$)  \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](01b_lmm_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## random slopes\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{For observation }j&\\text{ in cluster }i \\\\\n\\text{Level 1:}& \\\\\ny_{ij} &= b_{0i} + b_{1i} \\cdot x_{ij} + \\epsilon_{ij} \\\\\n\\text{Level 2:}& \\\\\nb_{0i} &= \\gamma_{00} + \\zeta_{0i} \\\\\nb_{1i} &= \\gamma_{10} + \\zeta_{1i} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](01b_lmm_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nintercepts vary\nslopes vary\n\nTODO PANEL PLOT\n\n\n## partial pooling\n\nIt's tempting to think that we could get the fixed intercept $\\gamma_{00}$ by calculating a simple linear model for each school and taking the average intercept. However, the multilevel model is more clever than that.
