#### Measurement Error and the need for SEM

We have been mentioning Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) for a few weeks now, but we haven't been very clear on what exactly it is. Is it CFA? Is it Path Analysis? In fact it is both - it is the overarching framework of which CFA and Path Analysis are just particular cases. The beauty comes in when we put the CFA and Path Analysis approaches together.

Path analysis, as we saw last week, offers a way of specifying and evaluating a *structural* model, in which variables relate to one another in various ways, via different (sometimes indirect) paths. Common models like our old friend multiple regression can be expressed in a Path Analysis framework.

Factor Analysis, on the other hand, brings something absolutely crucial to the table - it allows us to mitigate some of the problems which are associated with measurement error by specifying the existence of some latent variable which is measured via some observed variables. No question can perfectly measure someone's level of "anxiety", but if we take a set of 10 carefully chosen questions, we can consider the shared covariance between those 10 questions to represent the construct that is common between all of them (they all ask, in different ways, about "anxiety"), also modeling the unique error with which each individual question represents the entire construct.  

Combine them and we can reap the rewards of having both a *structural model* and a *measurement model*. The measurement model is our specification between the items we directly observed, and the latent variables of which we consider these items to be manifestations. The structural model is our specified model of the relationships between the latent variables.

__You can't test the structural model if the measurement model is bad__  

If you test the relationships between a set of latent factors, and they are not reliably measured by the observed items, then this error propagates up to influence the fit of the structural model.  
To test the measurement model, it is typical to *saturate* the structural model (i.e., allow all the latent variables to correlate with one another). This way any misfit is due to the measurement model only.  

Alternatively, we can fit individual CFA models for each construct and assess their fit (making any reasonable adjustments if necessary) prior to then fitting the full SEM.

# Exercising Exercises

:::frame
__Dataset: TPB_data.Rdata__  

The "Theory of Planned Behaviour" is a theory about why people engage in physical activity (i.e. exercise). 

The theory is represented in the diagram in @fig-tpb (only the latent variables and not the measured items are shown). **Attitudes** refer to the extent to which a person has a favourable view of exercising; **subjective norms** refer to whether they believe others whose opinions they care about believe exercise to be a good thing; and **perceived behavioural control** refers to the extent to which they believe exercising is under their control. **Intentions** refer to whether a person intends to exercise and **behaviour** is a measure of the extent to which they exercised. Each construct is measured using four items. 

```{r}
#| label: fig-tpb

`r qbegin(qcounter())`
Read in the data using the appropriate function. We've given you **.csv** files for a long time now, but it's good to be prepared to encounter all sorts of weird filetypes. 

Can you successfully read in from both types of data?  
`r qend()` 
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
Either one or the other of:
```{r read in data}
load(url("https://uoepsy.github.io/data/TPB_data.Rdata"))

TPB_data <- read.table("https://uoepsy.github.io/data/TPB_data.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")
```
`r solend()`

`r qbegin(qcounter())`
Test separate one-factor models for each construct.  
Are the measurement models satisfactory? *(check their fit measures)*. 
`r qend()` 
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
```{r fit CFA models}
# specify one factor CFA model for attitudes
attitude_model <- 'att =~ attitude1 + attitude2 + attitude3 + attitude4'
# estimate the model
attitude_model.est <- cfa(attitude_model, data=TPB_data)
# inspect the output
summary(attitude_model.est, fit.measures=T, standardized=T)
#check the model fit and that RMSEA<.05, SRMR<.05, TLI>0.95 and CFI>.95 and that all loadings are significant and >|.30|
modificationindices(attitude_model.est)
#check the largest modification indices to see if the expected parameter changes are large enough to justify any additional parameters in the  model
```

The above code shows you the steps you should run through for the attitudes construct. You should repeat these steps for each of:  

+ attitudes  
+ subjective norms  
+ perceived behavioural control  
+ intentions  
+ behaviour  

`r solend()`

`r qbegin(qcounter())`
Using lavaan syntax, specify a structural equation model that corresponds to the model in Figure \@ref(fig:tpb). For each construct use a latent variable measured by the corresponding items in the dataset. 
`r qend()` 
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
```{r specify TPB model}
TPB_model<-'
#measurement models for attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control
  
  att =~ attitude1 + attitude2 + attitude3 + attitude4
  SN =~ SN1 + SN2 + SN3 + SN4
  PBC =~ PBC1 + PBC2 + PBC3 + PBC4
  intent =~ int1 + int2 + int3 + int4
  beh =~ beh1 + beh2 + beh3 + beh4

#regressions  

  beh ~ intent + PBC
  intent ~ att + SN + PBC

#covariances between attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control
  
  att ~~ SN    
  att ~~ PBC
  SN ~~ PBC
'

```
`r solend()`

`r qbegin(qcounter())`
Estimate the model from Question A4 and evaluate the model  

+ Does the model fit well?  
+ Are the hypothesised paths significant?  

`r qend()` 
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

We can estimate the model using the `sem()` function.  
By default the `sem()` function will scale the latent variables by fixing the loading of the first item for each latent variable to 1 but we can override this by setting `std.lv=T` if we wanted to. By default, maximum likelihood estimation will be used.

```{r estimate TPB_model}
TPB_model.est<-sem(TPB_model, data=TPB_data, std.lv=T)

summary(TPB_model.est, fit.measures=T, standardized=T)
```

We can see that the model fits well according to RMSEA, SRMR, TLI and CFI. All of the hypothesised paths in the theory of planned behaviour are statistically significant.
`r solend()`

`r qbegin(qcounter())`
Examine the modification indices and expected parameter changes - are there any additional parameters you would consider including?  
`r qend()` 
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

```{r modindices}
modindices(TPB_model.est)
```

In this case, none of the expected parameter changes are large enough that we would consider including any additional parameters
`r solend()`

`r qbegin(qcounter())`
Test the indirect effect of attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control on behaviour via intentions.  

Remember, when you fit the model with `sem()`, use `se='bootstrap'` to get boostrapped standard errors (it may take a few minutes). When you inspect the model using `summary()`, get the 95% confidence intervals for parameters with `ci = TRUE`. 
`r qend()` 
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
First, let's name the paths in the structural equation model:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="85%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/msmr-w9.png")
```

To test these indirect effects we create new a parameter for each indirect effect:

```{r indirect effects}
TPB_model2 <- '
  #measurement models for attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control
  att =~ attitude1 + attitude2 + attitude3 + attitude4
  SN =~ SN1 + SN2 + SN3 + SN4
  PBC =~ PBC1 + PBC2 + PBC3 + PBC4
  intent =~ int1 + int2 + int3 + int4
  beh =~ beh1 + beh2 + beh3 + beh4

  #regressions  

  beh ~ b*intent + PBC
  intent ~ a1*att + a2*SN + a3*PBC

  ##covariances between attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control
  att ~~ SN    
  att ~~ PBC
  SN ~~ PBC

  ind1 := a1*b  #indirect effect of attitudes via intentions
  ind2 := a2*b  #indirect effect of subjective norms via intentions
  ind3 := a3*b  #indirect effect of perceived behavioural control via intentions
'
```

When we estimate the model, we request boostrapped standard errors: 

```{r estimate model 2}
TPB_model2.est<-sem(TPB_model2, se='bootstrap', data=TPB_data)
```

When we inspect the model, we request the 95% confidence intervals for parameters: 

```{r summarise model 2}
summary(TPB_model2.est, fit.measures=T, standardized=T, ci=T)

```

We can see that all of the indirect effects are statistically significant at p<.05 as none of the 95% confidence intervals for the coefficients include zero.

`r qbegin(qcounter())`
Write up your analysis as if you were presenting the work in academic paper, with brief separate 'Method' and 'Results' sections
`r qend()` 
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
An example write up would be as follows:

**Method**

We tested a theory of planned behaviour model of physical activity by fitting a structural equation model in which attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control, intentions and behaviour were latent variables defined by four items. We first tested the measurement models for each construct by fitting a one-factor CFA model.  Latent variable scaling was by fixing the loading of the first item for each construct to 1. Models were judged to fit well if $CFI$ and $TLI$ were $>.95$ and $RMSEA$ and $SRMR$ were $<.05$. 

Within the SEM, behaviour was regressed on intentions and perceived behavioural control and intentions were regressed on attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioiural control. In addition, attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control were allowed to covary. The indirect effects of attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control on behaviour were calculated as the product of the effect of the relevant predictor on the mediator (intentions) and the effect of the mediator on the outcome. The statistical significance of the indirect effects were evaluated using bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals with 1000 resamples.

In all cases models were fit using maximum likelihood estimation and model fit was judged to be good if CFI and TLI were $>.95$ and RMSEA and SRMR were $<.05$. Modification indices and expected parameter changes were inspected to identify any areas of local mis-fit but model modifications were only made if they could be justified on substantive grounds.

**Results**

All measurement models fit well ($CFI$ and $TLI >.95$ and $RMSEA$ and $SRMR <.05$). The full structural equation model also fit well ($CFI = 1.00$, $TLI = 1.00$, $RMSEA <.001$, $SRMR = 0.023$). Unstandardised parameter estimates are provided in Table  1. All of the hypothesised paths  were statistically significant at $p<.05$. The significant indirect effects suggested that intentions mediate the effects of attitudes, subjective norms, and  perceived behavioural control on behaviour whilst perceived behavioural control also has a direct effect on behaviour. Results thus provide support for a theory of planned behaviour model of physical activity.
