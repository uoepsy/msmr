This section focuses on the distinction between **binary** and **binomial**.  

For binary regression, all the data in our outcome variable has to be a 0 or a 1.  
For example, the `correct` variable below:  

```{r echo=FALSE}
tibble(participant = c(1,1,1),
       question=c(1,2,3),
       correct=c(1,0,1)) %>%
    rbind(rep("...",3)) %>%
    gt::gt()
```

But we can re-express this information in a different way, when we know the total number of questions asked: 

```{r echo=FALSE}
tibble(participant = c(1,2,3),
       questions_correct=c(2,1,3),
       questions_incorrect=c(1,2,0)) %>% 
    rbind(rep("...",3)) %>% 
    gt::gt()
```

To model data when it is in this form, we can express our outcome as `cbind(questions_correct, questions_incorrect)`
