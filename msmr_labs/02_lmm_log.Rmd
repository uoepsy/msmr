**Preliminaries**  
 
1. Open Rstudio, create a new R Script or RMarkdown document (whichever you prefer working with) and give it a title for this week. 

Load any of the packages you think you might be using today.  

By now you may have started get into a sort of routine with R, and you might know what functions you like, and which you don't. Because there are so many alternatives for doing the same thing, the packages and functions you use are very much up to you.   

If I'm planning on doing some multi-level modelling, I will tend to load these by default at the top: 
```{r}
library(tidyverse) # for everything
library(lme4) # for fitting models
library(broom.mixed) # for tidying model output

# Longitudinal Models

Last week when we introduced multilevel models (or "mixed effects models" or whatever we're calling them!), we saw in the lectures a little bit about the idea of having datapoints from the same participant _over time_. This kind of data tends to get termed "longitudinal" (mainly used to refer to studies which follow-up participants over the course of months or years). The lectures this week have also introduced this idea of 'change over time' by looking at some data from Public Health England.   
   
Let's work our way through an example. 
  

:::frame
__WeightMaintain Data Codebook__  

The weight maintenance data (`WeightMaintain3`), a made-up data set based on Lowe et al. (2014, Obesity, 22, 94-100), contains information on overweight participants who completed a 12-week weight loss program, and were then randomly assigned to one of three weight maintenance conditions:

* None (Control)  
* MR (meal replacements): use MR to replace one meal and snack per day  
* ED (energy density intervention): book and educational materials on purchasing and preparing foods lower in ED (reducing fat content and/or increasing water content of foods)  

Weight was assessed on day 1 of maintenance, 12 months post, 24 months post, and 36 months post.

It is available, in **.rda** format, at https://uoepsy.github.io/data/WeightMaintain3.rda  

```{r echo=FALSE}
load(url("https://uoepsy.github.io/data/WeightMaintain3.rda"))
data.frame(
  variable = names(WeightMaintain3),
  description = c("Participant ID","Weight Maintenance Condition ('None' = No maintenance program, 'MR' = Meal replacement, 'ED' = Energy Density intervention)", "Assessment number (0 = Day 1, 1 = 12 months, 2 = 24 months, 3 = 36 months)", "Difference in weight (lbs) from end of 12-week weight loss program")
) %>% knitr::kable()
```

`r qbegin("A1")`

`r qbegin("A2")`  

> Q: Overall, did the participants maintain their weight loss or did their weights change?

We need to remember that each of our participants has measurements at 4 assessments. We have randomly sampled participants, and then within them have measured multiple observations. So our observations are __not independent__. We're not interested in estimating differences between specific participants - our participants are just a random sample of people. But we do want to account for the dependency they introduce in our data. This is why we would want to fit a multilevel model and incorporate participant-level variation into our model structure.   

1. Fit an "intercept-only" model. 
2. Fit a model with weight change predicted by assessment.  
3. Compare the two models (use `anova(model1, model2)` to conduct a likelihood ratio test).

Things to think about:  

- We _cannot_ compare models that differ in both the fixed *and* random parts.  
- __For now__, ignore messages saying `boundary (singular) fit: see ?isSingular` (that comes in a couple of questions' time).    

`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
This is our null model:
```{r}
m.null <- lmer(WeightChange ~ 1 + (1 | ID), data=WeightMaintain3)
summary(m.null)
```
We can see the `3.77 / (3.77 + 6.43)`, or `r (3.77 / (3.77 + 6.43)) %>% round(.,2)` of the total variance is attributable to participant-level variation. 

Now lets suppose we want to compare this null model with a model with an effect of `Assessment` (to assess whether there is overall change over time).
Which model should we compare `m.null` to?  
```{r}
modA <- lmer(WeightChange ~ 1 + Assessment + (1 + Assessment | ID), data=WeightMaintain3)
modB <- lmer(WeightChange ~ 1 + Assessment + (1 | ID), data=WeightMaintain3)
```
A comparison between these `m.null` and `modA` will not be assessing the influence of _only_ the fixed effect of Assessment. Remember, we shouldn't compare models with different random effect structures.   
However, `modB` doesn't include our by-participant random effects of assessment, so comparing this to `m.null` is potentially going to misattribute random deviations in participants' change to being an overall effect of assessment.  

If we want to conduct a model comparison to isolate the effect of overall change over time (a fixed effect of `Assessment`), we _might_ want to compare these two models:
```{r}
m.base0 <- lmer(WeightChange ~ 1 + (1 + Assessment | ID), data=WeightMaintain3)
m.base <- lmer(WeightChange ~ 1 + Assessment + (1 + Assessment | ID), data=WeightMaintain3)
```
The first of these models is a bit weird to think about - how can we have by-participant random deviations of `Assessment` if we don't have a fixed effect of `Assessment`? That makes very little sense. What it is actually fitting is a model where there is assumed to be __no overall effect__ of Assessment. So the fixed effect is 0. 

```{r}
# Straightforward LRT
anova(m.base0, m.base)
```

This suggests that the inclusion Assessment does improve model fit, indicating that participants' weights changed over course of 36 month assessment period. 

`r solend()`

`r qbegin("A3")`
> Q: Did the experimental condition groups differ in overall weight change and rate of weight change (non-maintenance)?  

*Hint:* It helps to break it down. There are two questions here:  

  1. do groups differ overall?  
  2. do groups differ over time?  

We can begin to see that we're asking two questions about the `Condition` variable here: "is there an effect of Condition?" and "Is there an interaction between Assessment and Condition?".  

Try fitting two more models which incrementally build these levels of complexity, and compare them (perhaps to one another, perhaps to models from the previous question - think about what each comparison is testing!)  
  
`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
```{r}
m.int <- lmer(WeightChange ~ Assessment + Condition + (1 + Assessment | ID), 
              data=WeightMaintain3)
m.full <- lmer(WeightChange ~ Assessment*Condition + (1 + Assessment | ID), 
               data=WeightMaintain3)
```

We're going to compare each model to the previous one to examine the improvement in fit due to inclusion of each parameter. 
We could do this quickly with
```{r}
anova(m.base0, m.base, m.int, m.full)
```

- Conditions differed overall in weight change $\chi^2(2)=9.4, p = .009$  
- Conditions differed in change over assessment period $\chi^2(2)=40.4, p < .001$
  

`r solend()`


`r qbegin("A4")`
Okay. Let's talk about those "singular fits" messages we keep getting.  By now, you have hopefully fitted a number of models which incrementally add predictors, like those below: 
```{r}
m.base0 <- lmer(WeightChange ~ 1 + (1 + Assessment | ID), data=WeightMaintain3)
m.base <- lmer(WeightChange ~ Assessment + (1 + Assessment | ID), data=WeightMaintain3)
m.int <- lmer(WeightChange ~ Assessment + Condition + (1 + Assessment | ID), data=WeightMaintain3)
m.full <- lmer(WeightChange ~ Assessment * Condition + (1 + Assessment | ID), data=WeightMaintain3)
```

And many of these models were singular fits, and we just ignored them. We shouldn't have.  
  
The easiest way to think of this message is to think of it as telling us that there is _not enough variation in our data_ for our model to be estimated properly.  

Working out precisely _which bit of our model_ this is caused by can be difficult. One thing we should do is examine the variance estimates of the random effects (if you don't know what we mean here, I suggest you look back at Question A6 from last week's lab), to see if some are very small (i.e., the estimated variance is very close to zero).  
  
The other thing (just as, if not _more_ important), is to pay close attention to the study design.  
Re-read the description of the data, then ask yourself this question:  

Do we think participants will vary in:  

  a. their _starting_ weight differences `(1|ID)`?
  b. their weight change over the course of the assessment period `(0 + Assessment | ID)`?
  c. both `(1 + Assessment | ID)`?  

_Hint:_  What do we think the baseline weight should be? Should it be the same for everyone? If so, might we want to remove the random intercept, which we do by setting it to 0
  
Can you re-fit your models without encountering singular fits?   
`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
In this very specific research design, it may actually make a lot of sense to not model by-participant variation around the intercept.  
As baseline is at the very start of the weight maintenance, it makes sense that we wouldn't have very much (if any) participant variation in change at this point. 
Note that by removing the estimation of this parameter, our models now converge!
```{r}
m.base0 <- lmer(WeightChange ~ 1 + (0 + Assessment | ID), data=WeightMaintain3)
m.base <- lmer(WeightChange ~ 1 + Assessment + (0 + Assessment | ID), data=WeightMaintain3)
m.int <- lmer(WeightChange ~ 1 + Assessment + Condition + (0 + Assessment | ID), data=WeightMaintain3)
m.full <- lmer(WeightChange ~ 1 + Assessment * Condition + (0 + Assessment | ID), data=WeightMaintain3)
```

We can check if a model has a singular fit:  
```{r}
isSingular(m.base)
```

`r solend()`

`r qbegin("A5")`
Make a graph of the model fit *and* the observed means and standard errors at each time point for each condition.  

Try using the **effects** package (hint, does this help: `as.data.frame(effect("Assessment:Condition", model))`?)
`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
```{r}
library(effects)
ef <- as.data.frame(effect("Assessment:Condition", m.full))

ggplot(ef, aes(Assessment, fit, color=Condition)) + 
  geom_line() +
  stat_summary(data=WeightMaintain3, aes(y=WeightChange), 
               fun.data=mean_se, geom="pointrange", size=1) +
  theme_bw()
```
`r solend()`

`r qbegin("A6")`
Now let's move to interpreting the coefficients. 
Remember, we can get the coefficients using `fixef(model)`. 
We can also use `tidy(model)`, and similar to models fitted with `lm()`, we can pull out the bit of the `summary()` using:  
```{r eval=FALSE}
summary(model)$coefficients
```
  
From your model from the previous question which investigates whether conditions differed in their rate of weight change, examine the parameter estimates and interpret them (i.e., what does each parameter represent?)
`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
```{r}
round(coef(summary(m.full)), 3)
```

* `(Intercept)` ==> weight change at baseline in None group
* `Assessment`  ==> slope of weight change in None group
* `ConditionED` ==> baseline weight change in ED group relative to None group
* `ConditionMR` ==> baseline weight change in MR group relative to None group
* `Assessment:ConditionED`  ==> slope of weight change in ED group relative to None group
* `Assessment:ConditionMR`  ==> slope of weight change in MR groups relative to None group

`r solend()`

`r qbegin("A7")`
Can you state how the conditions differed?

In the exercises this week, we're going to concentrate on this in combination with the other topic this week, *Logistic* multi-level models. Then we're going to look at *contrasts* (they're a confusing topic, and can be pretty unintuitive, but we're going to have to do it sometime!), and talk a little bit about making inferences.  

# Logistic MLM

:::frame
**Don't forget to look back at other materials!** 

Back in USMR, we introduced logistic regression in week 10. The lectures followed the example of some [singing aliens that either survived or were splatted](https://uoepsy.github.io/usmr/lectures/lecture_9.html#1), and the exercises used some simulated data based on a hypothetical study [about inattentional blindness](https://uoepsy.github.io/usmr/labs/09_glm.html). 
That content will provide a lot of the groundwork for this week, so we recommend revisiting it if you feel like it might be useful.

:::rtip
__lmer() >> glmer()__

Remember how we simply used `glm()` and could specify the `family = "binomial"` in order to fit a logistic regression? Well it's much the same thing for multi-level models! 

+ Gaussian model: 
  - `lmer(y ~ x1 + x2 + (1 | g), data = data)`  
+ Binomial model:  
  - `glmer(y ~ x1 + x2 + (1 | g), data = data, family = binomial(link='logit'))`
  - or just `glmer(y ~ x1 + x2 + (1 | g), data = data, family = "binomial")`
  - or `glmer(y ~ x1 + x2 + (1 | g), data = data, family = binomial)`
    
:::

`r optbegin("Binary? Binomial? Huh?", olabel=F,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
Very briefly in the USMR materials we made the distinction between **binary** and **binomial**. This wasn't hugely relevant at the time just because we only looked at binary outcomes.  

For binary regression, all the data in our outcome variable has to be a 0 or a 1.  
For example, the `correct` variable below:  
<br>
```{r echo=FALSE}
tibble(participant = c(1,1,1),question=c(1,2,3),correct=c(1,0,1)) %>% rbind(rep("...",3)) %>%
  gt::gt()
```
<br>
But we can re-express this information in a different way, when we know the total number of questions asked: 

```{r echo=FALSE}
tibble(participant = c(1,2,3),questions_correct=c(2,1,3),questions_incorrect=c(1,2,0)) %>% rbind(rep("...",3)) %>% gt::gt()
```
<br>  
To model data when it is in this form, we can express our outcome as `cbind(questions_correct, questions_incorrect)`

In the `nwl` data set (accessed using the code above), participants with aphasia are separated into two groups based on the general location of their brain lesion: anterior vs. posterior. There is data on the numbers of correct and incorrect responses participants gave in each of a series of experimental blocks. There were 7 learning blocks, immediately followed by a test. Finally, participants also completed a follow-up test.

Data were also collect from healthy controls.

The broader research aim we are going to address today is to compare two groups (those with anterior vs. posterior lesions) with respect to their accuracy of responses over the course of the study.  

1. What is our outcome? 

*Hint:* Think carefully: there might be several variables which either fully or partly express the information we are considering the "outcome" here. 
`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=TRUE, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
1. The outcome here is (in words) "the proportion of correct answers in each block". This makes it tempting to look straight to the variable called `PropCorrect`. Unfortunately, this is encoded as a proportion (i.e., is bounded by 0 and 1), and of the models we have learned about so far, we don't definitely have the necessary tools to model this.  
    - linear regression = continuous *unbounded* outcome variable  
    - logistic regression = binomial, expressed as `0` or `1` if the number of trials per observation is 1, and expressed as `cbind(num_successes, num_failures)` if the number of trials per observation is >1. 
`r solend()`

`r qbegin("B3")`
> **Research Question 1:**  
> Is the learning rate (training blocks) different between these two groups?

**Hints**: 

- Do we want `cbind(num_successes, num_failures)`?
- Make sure we're running models on only the data we are actually interested in.  
- Think back to what we did in last week's exercises using model comparison via likelihood ratio tests (using `anova(model1, model2, model3, ...)`. We could use this approach for this question, to compare:

    - A model with just the change over the sequence of blocks
    - A model with the change over the sequence of blocks *and* an overall difference between groups
    - A model with groups differing with respect to their change over the sequence of blocks  

- What about the random effects part?  
    
    1. What are our observations grouped by? 
    2. What variables can vary within these groups? 
    3. What do you want your model to allow to vary within these groups?

`r optbegin("Suggested answers to the hints if you don't know where to start", olabel=FALSE, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

- Make sure we're running models on only the data we are actually interested in. 
    - We want only the learning blocks, and none of the healthy controls.
    - You might want to store this data in a separate object, but in the code for the solutio we will just use `filter()` *inside* the `glmer()`.   
  
- A model with just the change over the sequence of blocks:
    - **outcome ~ block**
- A model with the change over the sequence of blocks *and* an overall difference between groups:
    - **outcome ~ block + lesion_location**
- A model with groups differing with respect to their change *over the sequence of blocks:
    - **outcome ~ block * lesion_location**
    
- What are our observations grouped by? 
    - repeated measures by-participant. i.e., the `ID` variable
- What variables can vary within these groups? 
    - `Block` and `Phase`. Be careful though - you can create the `Phase` variable out of the `Block` variable, so really this is just one piece of information, encoded differently in two variables. 
    - The other variables (`lesion_location` and `group`) do **not** vary for each ID. Lesions don't suddenly change where they are located, nor do participants swap between being a patient vs a control (we don't need the group variable anyway as we are excluding the controls).  
What do you want your model to allow to vary within these groups?
    - Do you think the change over the course of the blocks is **the same** for everybody? Or do you think it varies? Is this variation important to think about in terms of your research question?

Let's try a different approach to this. Instead of fitting various models and comparing them via likelihood ratio tests, just fit the one model which could answer both parts of the question above.

## Interpreting fixed effects

:::frame

Take some time to remind yourself from USMR of the [interpretation of logistic regression coefficients](https://uoepsy.github.io/usmr/labs/09_glm.html#Introducing_GLM).  

The interpretation of the fixed effects of a logistic multi-level model are no different.  
We can obtain them using:  

- `fixef(model)`
- `summary(model)$coefficients`
- `tidy(model)` **from broom.mixed**  
- (there are probably more ways, but I can't think of them right now!)

It's just that for multi-level models, we can model by-cluster andom variation around these effects.  
:::

`r qbegin("B5")`

1. In `family = binomial(link='logit')`. What function is used to relate the linear predictors in the model to the expected value of the response variable?  
2. How do we convert this into something more interpretable?  

`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
 
1. The link function is the `logit`, or log-odds (other link functions are available).

2. To convert log-odds to odds, we can use `exp()`, to get odds and odds ratios.  

`r solend()`

`r qbegin("B6")`
Make sure you pay attention to trying to interpret each fixed effect from your models.  
These can be difficult, especially when it's logistic, and especially when there are interactions.

__Hang on.. p-values are back?!__ 

We noted at the end of last week that we don't have p-values for `lmer()`^[We also didn't get $R^2$. Check out [http://bbolker.github.io/mixedmodels-misc/glmmFAQ.html#how-do-i-compute-a-coefficient-of-determination-r2-or-an-analogue-for-glmms](http://bbolker.github.io/mixedmodels-misc/glmmFAQ.html#how-do-i-compute-a-coefficient-of-determination-r2-or-an-analogue-for-glmms)], but you might notice that we do now have them when we've fitted a model with `glmer()`?

The reason is partly just one of convention. There is a standard practice for determining the statistical significance of parameters in the generalised linear model, relying on asymptotic Wald tests which evaluate differences in log-likelihood.

# Inference in MLM  

Recall at the end of last week's lab we briefly noted that we don't have p-values for models fitted with `lmer()` 

:::statbox
__A quick reminder:__ a p-value is the probability of observing results as or more extreme than the data, _if the data were really generated by a hypothesised chance process_). 
:::


We highlighted a couple of approaches that we might take for drawing inferences, finding ways to compute p-values or confidence intervals.^[It's always important to note that aiming for a p-value or confidence interval to make a dichotomous decision is only _one approach_ to doing statistics. If you continue to develop your learning of statistics after this course (which we hope you will!), then you will find that there are other schools of thought that bring different benefits.]  We're going to now extend this to include a few more, and discuss the strengths and limitations of the different approaches.  

`r optbegin("Optional: Why no p-values?", olabel=F,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
When we are in the Gaussian ("normal") world, we're in the world of "sums of squares" (remember from USMR that we talked about the $F$ statistic for a simple linear model `lm()` representing the reduction in sums of squared residuals). But for the multilevel model, we can think of it as having residuals at multiple levels: we have the random variation of clusters around the fixed effects, and then random variation of observations around the cluster-level effects (more on this in Week 4). 
In the rare occasion that you have a perfectly balanced experimental design, then ratios of sums of squares for multi-level models follow an $F$-distribution, in which we know the numerator and denominator degrees of freedom (this means we can work out the degrees of freedom for the $t$-test of our fixed effect parameters). Unfortunately, in the real world where things are not often perfectly balanced, determining the denominator degrees of freedom becomes unclear. 
`r optend()`

Suppose that we have our toy dataset, and we are interested in whether practice (`hrs_week` variable) is associated with higher reading ages (`R_AGE` variable).  
```{r}
toys_read <- read_csv("https://uoepsy.github.io/data/toyexample.csv")
full_model <- lmer(R_AGE ~ hrs_week + (1 + hrs_week | toy_type), data = toys_read)
```

`r optbegin("Use a normal approximation (not advised)", olabel=F,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
Remember that the $t$ distribution starts to look more and more like the $z$ ("normal") distribution when degrees of freedom increase? We could just assume we have infinite degrees of freedom in our test statistics, and pretend that the $t$-values we get are actually $z$-values. This is "anti-conservative" inasmuch as it is not a very cautious approach, and we are likely to have a higher false positive rate (e.g. more chance of saying "there __is__ an effect!" when there actually isn't.)
```{r}
coefs <- as.data.frame(summary(full_model)$coefficients)
coefs$p.z <- 2 * (1 - pnorm(abs(coefs[,3])))
coefs
```
`r optend()`

`r optbegin("Satterthwaite df approximation", olabel=F,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
There have been a couple of methods proposed to estimate the degrees of freedom in order to provide a better approximation to the null distribution of our tests. 
The way the Satterthwaite method has been implemented in R will just add a column for p-values to your `summary(model)` output).  
Load the __lmerTest__ package, refit the model, and voila!  
```{r}
library(lmerTest)
full_model <- lmer(R_AGE ~ hrs_week + (1 + hrs_week | toy_type), data = toys_read)
summary(full_model)$coefficients
```

:::int
__Reporting__  


To account for the extra uncertainty brought by the inclusion of random effects in the model, the degrees of freedom in the coefficients tests have been corrected via Satterthwaite's method.   
...   
...   
Weekly hours of reading practice was associated increased reading age ($\beta = 1.14,\ SE = 0.30,\ t(17.52^*) = 3.87,\ p = .001$).

:::

__Note:__ if you have the __lmerTest__ package loaded, then all the models you fit with `lmer()` will show p-values! If you want to stop this, then you will have to detach/unload the package, and refit the model.  
```{r}
detach("package:lmerTest", unload=TRUE)
```

`r optend()`

`r optbegin("Kenward Rogers df approximations", olabel=F,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
The Kenward-Rogers approach is slightly more conservative than the Satterthwaite method, and has been implemented for model comparison between a full model and a restricted model (a model without the parameter of interest), using the KR adjustment for the denominator degrees of freedom in the $F$-test.  
For this, models must be fitted with REML, __not__ ML. The function `KRmodcomp()` will take care of this and re-fit them for you.   
```{r}
library(pbkrtest)
restricted_model <- lmer(R_AGE ~ 1 + (1 + hrs_week | toy_type), data = toys_read)
full_model <- lmer(R_AGE ~ hrs_week + (1 + hrs_week | toy_type), data = toys_read)
KRmodcomp(full_model, restricted_model)
```

:::int
__Reporting__

...  
...  
Inclusion of weekly hours of reading practice as a predictor was associated with an improvement in model fit ($F(1,17.74^*) = 14.64,\ p = .001$).
:::
`r optend()`

`r optbegin("Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT)", olabel=F,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
Conduct a model comparison between your model and a restricted model (a model without the parameter of interest), evaluating the change in log-likelihood ("likelihood" is a function that associates to a parameter the probability (or probability density) of observing the given sample data - for a quick intro, see [here](lvp.html)). This method assumes that the ratio of two likelihoods is _asymptotically_ $\chi^2$ distributed, and so may be unreliable for small samples.  

Models must be fitted with ML, __not__ REML. The function `anova()` will re-fit them for you.   
```{r message=T,warning=T}
restricted_model <- lmer(R_AGE ~ 1 + (1 + hrs_week | toy_type), data = toys_read)
full_model <- lmer(R_AGE ~ hrs_week + (1 + hrs_week | toy_type), data = toys_read)
anova(restricted_model, full_model, test = "Chisq")
```

:::int
__Reporting__  

A likelihood ratio test indicated that the inclusion of weekly hours of reading practice as a predictor was associated with an improvement in model fit ($\chi^2(1) = 11.81, p < .001$).
:::

`r optend()`
`r optbegin("Optional: Parametric Bootstrap LRT",olabel=F,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`  
There are also various "bootstrapping" methods which it is worth looking into. Think back to USMR when we first learned about hypothesis testing. Remember that we did lots of simulating data, so that we can compare what we actually observe with what we would expect if the null hypothesis were true? By doing this, we were essentially _creating_ a null distribution, so that our calculating a p-value can become an issue of summarising data (e.g. what proportion of our null distribution is more extreme than our observed)

Instead of assuming that the likelihood ratio test statistics are $\chi^2$-distributed, we can bootstrap this test instead. This approach simulates data from the simpler model, fits both the simple model and the complex model and evaluates the change in log-likelihood. By doing this over and over again, we build a distribution of what changes in log-likelihood we would be likely to see if the more complex model is not any better. In this way it actually constructs a distribution reflecting our null hypothesis, against which we can then compare our actual observed effect
```{r echo=F}
set.seed(993)
```
```{r eval=FALSE}
library(pbkrtest)
PBmodcomp(full_model, restricted_model, nsim=1000)
```

:::int
__Reporting__  

A parametric bootstrap likelihood ratio test (R = 1000) indicated that the inclusion of weekly hours of reading practice as a predictor was associated with an improvement in model fit ($LRT = 11.79, p = .004$).
:::

`r optend()`
`r optbegin("Optional: Parametric Bootstrap Confidence Intervals",olabel=F,toggle=params$TOGGLE)`  
Much the same as above, but with just one model we simulate data many times and refit the model, so that we get an empirical distribution that we can use to construct confidence intervals for our effects. 
```{r eval=FALSE}
confint(full_model, method="boot")  
```

95% Confidence Intervals were obtained via parametric bootstrapping with 1000 iterations.

<!-- `r optbegin("Case-based Bootstrap Confidence Intervals",olabel=F,toggle=params$TOGGLE)` -->
<!-- We'll get on to assumptions in a later week, but it's worth noting that there are many different types of bootstrapping that we can conduct, and these vary in the assumptions they rely on. For instance, the parametric bootstrap discussed above assumes that explanatory variables are fixed and that model specification and the distributions such as $\zeta_i \sim N(0,\sigma_{\zeta})$ and $\varepsilon_i \sim N(0,\sigma_{\varepsilon})$ are correct.   -->
<!-- An alternative is to __resample with replacement__ from our data, and refit the model on many resamples, so we can obtain an empirical bootstrap distribution. This doesn't have to rely on the distributional assumptions of parametric bootstrapping - we just need to ensure that we correctly specify the hierarchical dependency of data. It does, however, require the decision of at which levels to resample (this is discussed more in week 4).  -->

# Contrasts - A quick overview

We largely avoided the discussion of cotrasts in USMR because they can be quite incomprehensible at first, and we wanted to focus on really consolidating our learning of the linear model basics.  

:::frame
**What are contrasts and when are they relevant?**  
  
Recall when we have a categorical predictors? To continue the example in USMR, Martin's lectures considered the utility of different types of toys (Playmo, SuperZings, and Lego).  
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="400px", fig.cap="[USMR Week 9 Lecture](https://uoepsy.github.io/usmr/lectures/lecture_8.html#36) utility of different toy_types"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/loglong/leccontrasts.png")
```

When we put a categorical variable into our model as a predictor, we are always relying on **contrasts**, which are essentially just combinations of 0s & 1s which we use to define the differences which we wish to test.  

The default, *treatment* coding, treats one level as a **reference group**, and results in coefficients which compare each group to that reference.  
When a variable is defined as a **factor** in R, there will always be an attached "attribute" defining the contrasts:  
```{r}
#read the data
toy_utils <- read_csv("https://uoepsy.github.io/msmr/data/toyutility.csv")

#make type a factor
toy_utils <- toy_utils %>%
  mutate(
    type = factor(type)
  )
```


```{r}
# look at the contrasts
contrasts(toy_utils$type)
```
Currently, the resulting coefficients from the contrasts above will correspond to:

- Intercept = estimated mean utility for Lego (reference group)
- typeplaymo = estimated difference in mean utility Playmo vs Lego
- typezing = estimated different in mean utility Zing vs Lego

:::

`r qbegin("B1")`
Read in the toy utility data from [https://uoepsy.github.io/msmr/data/toyutility.csv](https://uoepsy.github.io/msmr/data/toyutility.csv).  
We're going to switch back to the normal `lm()` world here for a bit, so no multi-level stuff while we learn more about contrasts.

1. Fit the model below 
    ```{r}
    model_treatment <- lm(UTILITY ~ type, data = toy_utils)
    ```
2. Calculate the means for each group, and the differences between them, to match them to the coefficients from the model above

`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

You don't have to do it this way. This was just the first way to calculate the difference in means that came to my head. `group_by()` will definitely come in handy though. 
```{r}
toy_utils %>% group_by(type) %>%
  summarise(
    mutil = mean(UTILITY)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    diff = mutil - mutil[type == "lego"]
  )

coef(model_treatment)
```
`r solend()`


:::frame
**How can we change the way contrasts are coded?**  

In our regression model we are fitting an intercept plus a coefficient for each explanatory variable, and any categorical predictors are coded as 0s and 1s.  

We can add constraints to our the way our contrasts are coded. In fact, with the default **treatment** coding, we already have applied one - we constrained them such that the intercept ($\beta_0$) = the mean of one of the groups. 

`r optbegin("Optional: Why constraints?", olabel=FALSE, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

Why do we not have:  

- `Intercept`
- `typelego`
- `typeplaymo`
- `typezing`

The model has would become **not identifiable**. We cannot distinguish any more whether the group mean is due to a group effect or not. For example, we can get the same group mean $μ_{lego}=10$, say, either by setting:

- $\beta_0=0$ and $\beta_1=10$, which interprets as "there is an effect due to being lego"
- $\beta_0=10$ and $\beta_1=0$, which interprets as "there is no effect due to being lego"

`r optend()`

The other common constraint that is used is the **sum-to-zero** constraint. 
Under this constraint the interpretation of the coefficients becomes:

- $\beta_0$ represents the global mean (sometimes referred to as the "grand mean"). 
- $\beta_1$ the effect due to group $i$ — that is, the mean response in group $i$ minus the global mean.  

**Changing contrasts in R**  
There are two main ways to change the contrasts in R. 

1. Change them in your data object.
    ```{r}
    contrasts(toy_utils$type) <- "contr.sum"
    ```
2. Change them *only* in the fit of your model (don't change them in the data object)
    ```{r}
    model_sum <- lm(UTILITY ~ type, contrasts = list(type = "contr.sum"), data = toy_utils)
    ```

:::

`r qbegin("B2")`

1. Using sum-to-zero contrasts, refit the same model of utility by toy-type.  
2. Then calculate the global mean, and the differences from each mean to the global mean, to match them to the coefficients

`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

```{r}
model_sum <- lm(UTILITY ~ type, contrasts = list(type = "contr.sum"), data = toy_utils)

globmean <- mean(toy_utils$UTILITY)

toy_utils %>% group_by(type) %>%
  summarise(
    mutil = mean(UTILITY)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    diff = mutil - globmean
  )

coef(model_sum)
```

`r solend()`

`r qbegin("B3")`

This code is what we used to answer question A5 above, only we have edited it to change lesion location to be fitted with sum-to-zero contrasts.  
  
The interpretation of this is going to get pretty tricky - we have a logistic regression, and we have sum-to-zero contrasts, and we have an interaction.. &#x1f92f;  

Can you work out the interpretation of the fixed effects estimates?  

```{r echo=TRUE}
nwl_test <- filter(nwl, block > 7, !is.na(lesion_location)) %>%
  mutate(
    Phase = fct_relevel(factor(Phase),"Immediate")
  )

m.recall.loc.sum <- glmer(cbind(NumCorrect, NumError) ~ Phase * lesion_location + (Phase | ID), 
                      contrasts = list(lesion_location = "contr.sum"),
                  nwl_test, family="binomial")
rbind(summary(m.recall.loc.sum)$coefficients,
      summary(m.recall.loc)$coefficients)

```

`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

* `(Intercept)` ==> Overall performance in immediate test. This is the overall log-odds of answering correctly in the immediate test. 
* `PhaseFollow-up`  ==> Average change in performance from immediate to follow-up test. 
* `lesion_location1` ==> Anterior lesion group performance in immediate test relative to *overall average* performance in immediate test
* `PhaseFollow-up:lesion_location1` ==> Change in performance from immediate to follow-up test, anterior lesion group relative to overall average
  
  
**???**  
How do we know that `lesion_location1` is the *anterior* and not the *posterior* lesion group? 
We need to check the what the contrasts look like:  
```{r}
contrasts(nwl_test$lesion_location) <- "contr.sum"
contrasts(nwl_test$lesion_location)
```
Because there are only two levels to this variable, the estimate will simply flip sign (positive/negative) depending on which way the contrast is levelled.  

`r optbegin("Optional: I liked my coefficients being named properly", olabel=FALSE, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

```{r}
colnames(contrasts(nwl_test$lesion_location)) <- "PeppaPig"

contrasts(nwl_test$lesion_location)

modeltest <- glmer(cbind(NumCorrect, NumError) ~ Phase * lesion_location + (Phase | ID),
                  nwl_test, family="binomial")
summary(modeltest)$coefficients
```
`r optend()`

`r solend()`

`r qbegin("B4")`
Try playing around with the Toy Utility dataset again, fitting sum-to-zero contrasts.  
Can you re-level the factor first? What happens when you do?  

**Tip:** You can always revert easily to the treatment coding scheme, either by reading in the data again, or using
```{r}
contrasts(toy_utils$type) <- NULL
contrasts(toy_utils$type)
```
`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=TRUE, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
No solution, just play!
