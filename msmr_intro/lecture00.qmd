## Labs

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}
- a time and place to work on the exercises

- you will be working in groups

- a team of tutors will be there to help

- labs are the best place to get to grips with R and statistics  

- you are expected to attend

The times they are a' changing!  
Both Labs are on Fridays  
10:00-12:00 and 14:10-16:00  
Check your timetable!

::: notes
- statistics, and especially R, is a very _practical_ skill.  

- we can't teach people to swim by just giving lectures on how to swim.

## Discussions

![](img/forum_ss.png)

- **piazza** discussion forums for the course on Learn

  + ask questions, share experiences, talk to the course team
  
  + post anonymously if preferred
  
  + an important way to keep in touch

## ![](img/exam.svg){width=70px style="transform: translateY(50%);"} Course Quizzes (20%)


- 4 assessed quizzes (2 for each part of the course)
- quizzes each have approximately 10 questions
- for each quiz, **one attempt** which must be completed within 60 min 

:::mypinkblock

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="90%"}
Note that quizzes are not weekly as they were for USMR.  
They will be in Week 3, 5, 8 and 10

## ![](img/exam.svg){width=70px style="transform: translateY(50%);"} Individual Report (80%)

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="45%"}
### What you'll have to do

- Two sections (one for each part of the course)

- Each section has a dataset and a series of research aims to address

- Answers written up as a report (recommended structure: 'methods' and 'results')  

- .Rmd/.R file submitted separately

:::
::: {.column width="10%"}
:::
::: {.column width="45%"}
### What we're looking for

- Selecting appropriate method(s) to address research aims

- Explaining and justifying decisions made

- Implementing methods in R

- Interpreting and presenting findings

## Making the most of the course

- active engagement! 

- attend lectures, ask questions in lectures/labs/discussion forum/office hours
  - no such thing as a stupid question
  - learning stats is cumulative - feel free to ask questions about things we learned in USMR too!
  
- keep on top of quizzes
  - useful checkpoints!

- remember: 
  - some things will feel difficult at first
  - R's help docs contain examples! 
  - google is your friend!
  - trial and error is a great way to learn!


## RStudio/RStudio Server

:::mypinkblock
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="90%"}
By week 7, please switch to using a local installation of RStudio.

::::
:::

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}
#### Why?

- We only have a license for the server for teaching purposes - it can't be used for dissertations.  

- Installing locally means no reliance on internet connection.

- Good preparation for any future work you do that might need R!  
:::
::: {.column width="10%"}
:::
::: {.column width="45%"}
#### How?

- instructions at <https://edin.ac/3B0oi5A>  

- process is a bit more involved. Follow the instructions **carefully**!

- just ask (labs/office hours) if you get stuck with it and we can try to help
