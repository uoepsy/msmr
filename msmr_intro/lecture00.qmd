## Labs

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}
- a time and place to work on the exercises

- encouraged to continue to work in groups from USMR

- a team of tutors will be there to help

:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
![](img/playmo_group.jpg)

::: mypinkblock

- labs are the best place to get to grips with R and statistics  

- you are expected to attend

## Discussions

![](img/forum_ss.png)

- **piazza** discussion forums for the course on Learn

  + ask questions, share experiences, talk to the course team
  
  + post anonymously if preferred
  
  + an important way to keep in touch

## ![](img/exam.svg){width=70px style="transform: translateY(50%);"} Course Quizzes (20%)


- 9 assessed quizzes
- quizzes each have approximately 10 questions
- for each quiz, **one attempt** which must be completed within 60 min 


. . .

::: myblock
**released** Fridays at 17:00

**due** the following Friday at 17:00

**quizzes should be taken individually**

## ![](img/exam.svg){width=70px style="transform: translateY(50%);"} Individual Report (80%)

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="45%"}
### What you'll have to do

- Two sections (one for each part of the course)

- Each section has a dataset and a series of research aims to address

- Answers written up as a report (recommended structure: 'methods' and 'results')  

- .Rmd/.R file submitted separately

:::
::: {.column width="10%"}
:::
::: {.column width="45%"}
### What we're looking for

- Selecting appropriate method(s) to address research aims

- Explaining and justifying decisions made

- Implementing methods in R

- Interpreting and presenting findings

## Making the most of the course {.smaller}

- active engagement! 

- attend lectures, ask questions in lectures/labs/discussion forum/office hours
  - no such thing as a stupid question
  - learning stats is cumulative - feel free to ask questions about things we learned in USMR too!
  
- keep on top of quizzes
  - useful checkpoints!

- remember: 
  - some things will feel difficult at first
  - R's help docs contain examples! 
  - google is your friend!
  - trial and error is a great way to learn!


## RStudio/RStudio Server

:::mypinkblock
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="90%"}
Please switch to using a local installation of RStudio.

::::
:::

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}
#### Why?

- We only have a license for the server for teaching purposes - it can't be used for dissertations.  

- Installing locally means no reliance on internet connection.

- Good preparation for any future work you do that might need R!

::: {.column width="45%"}
#### How?

- instructions at <https://edin.ac/3B0oi5A>  

- process is a bit more involved. Follow the instructions **carefully**!

- just ask (labs/office hours) if you get stuck with it and we can try to help
