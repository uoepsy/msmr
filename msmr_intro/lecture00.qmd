#### Multilevel Modelling (Weeks 1-5)
__Dan Mirman__  
![](img/dan.jpg){width=100px}

- All things multi-level modeling 
    - (aka mixed effects models/random effect models/hierarchical models)

## Shape of the Course

Much the same as USMR!  

::: {layout=[[1,5],[1,5],[1,5],[1,5],[1,5]]}

![](img/lecture.svg){width=60px}

**Lectures**<br/>
often include live coding

![](img/readings.png){width=60px}

**Readings/Walkthroughs/Papers**<br/>
you're encouraged to work along with these

![](img/labs.svg){width=60px}

**Labs (Exercises)**<br/>
work individually or in groups, with help on hand from a team of tutors

![](img/forum.svg){width=60px}

**Discussion Forums and Support**<br/>
via learn page

![](img/exam.svg){width=60px}

**Assessment**<br/>
Weekly quizzes and an individual report (covers both blocks)

### Lectures & Readings

- broadly, about _concepts_

  + statistics
  
  + coding
  
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Exercises

- broadly, _how to_

  + coding

  + data manipulation
  
  + statistics

- lots of hints, links to readings

:::: myyellowblock
solutions will be available at the end of each week

## Labs

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}
- a time and place to work on the exercises

- encouraged to continue to work in groups from USMR

- a team of tutors will be there to help

:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
![](img/playmo_group.jpg)
:::

::::

::: mypinkblock

- labs are the best place to get to grips with R and statistics  

- you are expected to attend

:::

## This stuff is cumulative...

- often feels like a "step up"  
- a lot of this builds on content that we covered in USMR  

<br> 

- but..  

<br>

- this is (probably) the first time you're seeing this stuff
- no one expects anyone to immediately just 'get' statistics

## This stuff is cumulative... 

- want to do the exercises and see what questions arise?  
- have questions about stuff from this week?  
- have questions about stuff from previous weeks?  
- have questions about stuff from usmr?  
- can't figure out what questions you have because it's all a big confusing mess?  

**Come to labs! Come to office hours!**  
 




<!-- ## Discussions -->

## ![](img/exam.svg){width=70px style="transform: translateY(50%);"} Course Quizzes (20%)


- 9 assessed quizzes
- quizzes each have approximately 10 questions
- for each quiz, **one attempt** which must be completed within 60 min 


. . .

::: myblock
**released** Fridays at 17:00

**due** the following Friday at 17:00

**quizzes should be taken individually**

## ![](img/exam.svg){width=70px style="transform: translateY(50%);"} Individual Report (80%)

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="45%"}
### What you'll have to do

- Two sections (one for each part of the course)

- Each section has a dataset and a series of research aims to address

- Answers written up as a report (recommended structure: 'methods' and 'results')  

- ./R.Rmd/.qmd file submitted separately

:::
::: {.column width="10%"}
:::
::: {.column width="45%"}
### What we're looking for

- Using appropriate method(s) to address research aims

- Explaining and justifying decisions made

- Implementing methods in R

- Interpreting and presenting findings

## Making the most of the course

- active engagement! 

- keep on top of quizzes
  - useful checkpoints!

- remember: 
  - some things will feel difficult at first
  - R's help docs contain examples! 
  - google is your friend!
  - trial and error is a great way to learn!

- attend lectures and labs, and **ask questions**   

## "no such thing as a stupid question"

## RStudio/RStudio Server

:::mypinkblock
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="90%"}
Please switch to using a local installation of RStudio.

::::
:::

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}
#### Why?

- We only have a license for the server for teaching purposes - it can't be used for dissertations.  

- Installing locally means no reliance on internet connection.

- Good preparation for any future work you do that might need R!

::: {.column width="45%"}
#### How?

- instructions at <https://edin.ac/3B0oi5A>  

- process is a bit more involved. Follow the instructions **carefully**!

- just ask (labs/office hours) if you get stuck with it and we can try to help
